A. 一句话与定位（30） / One-liner & Positioning (30)

1.	你用一句话描述 Mandate（不是 slogan），必须包含对象、动作、结果，怎么说？
How would you describe Mandate in one sentence (not a slogan), including who, what action, and what result?
**答案/Answer**: Asymp帮助部署10+自主agent的团队在agent执行速度下实现人类介入，通过实时路由、归因和学习闭环。/ Asymp helps teams deploying 10+ autonomous agents intervene at agent speed through real-time routing, attribution, and learning loops.

2.	"intervene at agent speed"具体快多少？从多少秒到多少秒？
How fast specifically is "intervene at agent speed"? From how many seconds to how many seconds?
**答案/Answer**: 目标TTI (Time-to-Intervention) P50 <60秒；通知送达99.5%在5秒内。/ Target TTI P50 <60 seconds; notification delivery 99.5% within 5 seconds.

3.	你解决的是 incident response、governance、observability，还是 on-call coordination？哪个是主？
Are you solving incident response, governance, observability, or on-call coordination? Which is primary?
**答案/Answer**: 主要是operational coordination——协调谁应该知道什么、何时介入。不是observability（那是Datadog），不是rollback（那是Rubrik）。/ Primarily operational coordination—coordinating who should know what and when to intervene. Not observability (that's Datadog), not rollback (that's Rubrik).

4.	你的产品属于"platform"还是"tool"？你希望用户把它当成哪一个？
Is your product a "platform" or a "tool"? Which do you want users to see it as?
**答案/Answer**: 一个实时协作网络，而不是一个plane或tool。希望用户视为agent时代组织运行方式的定义。/ A real-time collaboration network, not a plane or tool. We want users to see it as a definition of how organizations operate in the agent era.

5.	你是替代 PagerDuty/Slack war room，还是补全它们？
Do you replace PagerDuty/Slack war room, or complement them?
**答案/Answer**: 补全它们。PagerDuty不懂agent actions，我们在上层提供agent-native的路由和协调。/ Complement them. PagerDuty doesn't understand agent actions; we provide agent-native routing and coordination on top.

6.	你要把"routing"路由到谁？人？机器人？审批系统？回滚系统？
Who do you route to? People? Bots? Approval systems? Rollback systems?
**答案/Answer**: 主要是人（affected owners）。不是审批系统，不是回滚系统。我们把正确的人在正确的时间拉进来。/ Primarily people (affected owners). Not approval systems, not rollback systems. We bring the right people in at the right time.

7.	"pre-action routing not pre-action approval"是什么意思？举一个具体 action。
What does "pre-action routing not pre-action approval" mean? Give a specific action example.
**答案/Answer**: 例如agent要执行`kubectl delete pod`，我们不阻塞它等人批准，而是打上`monitored_executed`标签、通知相关owner、记录以便事后快速定位。/ E.g., when agent executes `kubectl delete pod`, we don't block for approval—we tag it `monitored_executed`, notify affected owners, and record for fast post-hoc localization.

8.	你的系统输出的"最小单位"是什么？事件、行动、任务、run、trace、incident？
What is the minimum unit your system outputs? Event, action, task, run, trace, or incident?
**答案/Answer**: Action（动作）。每个agent的tool call是一个action，可聚合为incident。/ Action. Each agent tool call is an action, which can be aggregated into incidents.

9.	你要改变的用户习惯是什么？他们今天怎么做？你要他们怎么做？
What user habit do you want to change? How do they do it today vs. how you want them to do it?
**答案/Answer**: 今天：出事后满世界找人、查日志、开war room。我们要：系统自动告诉你谁做了什么、该找谁、怎么修。/ Today: scramble to find people, check logs, start war rooms after incidents. We want: system automatically tells you who did what, who to call, how to fix.

10.	你认为未来 agent 事故的主要类型是什么？你最先覆盖哪一类？
What do you think will be the main types of agent incidents? Which do you cover first?
**答案/Answer**: 主要类型：不知道谁干的、重复犯错、不知道系统状态。先覆盖"不知道谁干的"——归因和路由。/ Main types: don't know who did it, repeat mistakes, unclear system state. First cover "don't know who did it"—attribution and routing.

11.	你的系统是"控制"还是"协调"？你更反对哪个词，为什么？
Is your system "control" or "coordination"? Which word do you oppose more and why?
**答案/Answer**: 协调。反对"控制"——控制意味着中央决策瓶颈，我们是去中心化的介入能力。/ Coordination. Oppose "control"—control implies centralized decision bottleneck; we provide decentralized intervention capabilities.

12.	你如何避免被理解成"另一个控制平面/另一个审批系统"？
How do you avoid being seen as "another control plane/another approval system"?
**答案/Answer**: 明确声明：Not an approval system, not a centralized agent controller。我们的核心是缩短人类介入反应时间，不是阻断行为。/ Clear positioning: Not an approval system, not a centralized agent controller. Our core is shortening human intervention response time, not blocking actions.

13.	你的产品最像哪个现有品类？最不像哪个？
Which existing category does your product most resemble? Least resemble?
**答案/Answer**: 最像PagerDuty（on-call routing），但为agent-native设计。最不像SIEM/DLP（我们不做安全分析）。/ Most like PagerDuty (on-call routing) but designed agent-native. Least like SIEM/DLP (we don't do security analysis).

14.	你的 wedge 是哪个最窄的场景？
What is your narrowest wedge scenario?
**答案/Answer**: Agent执行了一个动作→立刻知道谁做的→立刻通知该知道的人。这个闭环。/ Agent executes an action → immediately know who did it → immediately notify who should know. This closed loop.

15.	你的产品在一天内被使用的次数大概是多少？为什么？
Approximately how many times per day is your product used? Why?
**答案/Answer**: 取决于agent活动量。100 agents团队可能每天数百到数千次事件。被动使用（自动通知）远多于主动使用。/ Depends on agent activity. A 100-agent team might see hundreds to thousands of events daily. Passive use (auto-notifications) far exceeds active use.

16.	你的产品应该嵌在哪个地方：IDE、CI、runtime、orchestrator、chat、incident tool？
Where should your product be embedded: IDE, CI, runtime, orchestrator, chat, or incident tool?
**答案/Answer**: 主要在chat（Slack/Teams）和incident tool集成。数据来自runtime/orchestrator的MCP hooks。/ Primarily in chat (Slack/Teams) and incident tool integration. Data comes from runtime/orchestrator MCP hooks.

17.	你认为这个市场的"核心货币"是什么？时间、风险、责任、金钱、声誉？
What is the "core currency" of this market? Time, risk, responsibility, money, or reputation?
**答案/Answer**: 时间——具体是TTI (Time-to-Intervention)。能多快意识到问题、多快找到对的人介入。/ Time—specifically TTI (Time-to-Intervention). How fast can you realize something's wrong and get the right person to intervene.

18.	如果只能保留一个功能，你保哪个？为什么？
If you could only keep one feature, which would you keep and why?
**答案/Answer**: Attribution（归因）——因为没有"谁做了什么"的答案，其他一切都无从谈起。/ Attribution—because without "who did what," nothing else can happen.

19.	如果只能删除一个功能，你删哪个？为什么？
If you could only remove one feature, which would you remove and why?
**答案/Answer**: Postmortem自动化——因为可以先用外部工具替代，核心价值是实时的routing和attribution。/ Postmortem automation—because it can be substituted with external tools; core value is real-time routing and attribution.

20.	你如何定义"agent deployment"？
How do you define "agent deployment"?
**答案/Answer**: 一个能自主执行tool calls影响真实系统（代码、数据、配置）的AI agent在生产环境运行。/ An AI agent that can autonomously execute tool calls affecting real systems (code, data, config) running in production.

21.	你如何定义"autonomous agent"？必须满足哪些条件？
How do you define "autonomous agent"? What conditions must be met?
**答案/Answer**: 能在无人审批下执行会产生副作用的动作。条件：有tool access、可自主决策调用、影响真实系统。/ Can execute side-effect-producing actions without human approval. Conditions: has tool access, can autonomously decide to call, affects real systems.

**答案/Answer**: 主要是agent和human。归因回答"哪个actor（人或agent）执行了哪个action造成了哪个effect"。/ Primarily agent and human. Attribution answers "which actor (human or agent) executed which action causing which effect."

24.	你如何定义"state"？你追踪的是数据 state、执行 state、还是组织 state？
How do you define "state"? Do you track data state, execution state, or organizational state?
**答案/Answer**: 主要是执行state和组织state——谁在做什么、谁负责什么、当前incident状态。数据state留给源系统。/ Primarily execution state and organizational state—who's doing what, who's responsible for what, current incident status. Data state left to source systems.

25.	你的系统输出的"真相"是什么？你能保证哪些不变量？
What "truth" does your system output? What invariants can you guarantee?
**答案/Answer**: 真相：什么发生了、谁做的、谁被影响。不变量：完整事件链、不可篡改的时间戳、每个action有明确attribution。/ Truth: what happened, who did it, who was affected. Invariants: complete event chain, tamper-evident timestamps, every action has clear attribution.

26.	你用什么指标证明你成功？TTI/TTC/MTTR/重复事故率？
What metrics prove your success? TTI/TTC/MTTR/repeat incident rate?
**答案/Answer**: 主要是TTI (Time-to-Intervention)和重复事故率。其次是MTTR，但MTTR受客户自身能力影响太大。/ Primarily TTI (Time-to-Intervention) and repeat incident rate. Secondarily MTTR, but MTTR depends too much on customer's own capabilities.

27.	你的产品是让事故更少，还是让事故更可控？你更押哪一个？
Does your product reduce incidents or make them more controllable? Which do you bet on?
**答案/Answer**: 更可控。犯错不可怕，可怕的是犯同样的错、看不见的破坏、不知道找谁。/ More controllable. Making mistakes isn't scary—making the same mistake, invisible damage, and not knowing who to call are.

28.	你为什么现在做，而不是等两年巨头补齐？
Why do it now instead of waiting two years for giants to catch up?
**答案/Answer**: 市场验证问题存在（Rubrik/Datadog都在做），但他们解决的是错误版本。现在切入可以建立ownership graph和learning loop这些他们没有的。/ Market validates the problem (Rubrik/Datadog both working on it), but they're solving the wrong version. Entering now lets us build ownership graph and learning loop that they don't have.

29.	如果 Datadog 明天加一个"agent on-call routing"，你还剩什么？
If Datadog adds "agent on-call routing" tomorrow, what do you have left?
**答案/Answer**: Learning loop（防止重复）、跨平台ownership graph、pre-action routing。Datadog DNA是observability，做routing是side feature。/ Learning loop (preventing repeat), cross-platform ownership graph, pre-action routing. Datadog's DNA is observability; routing would be a side feature.

30.	如果 Rubrik 明天做"real-time owner notification"，你还剩什么？
If Rubrik does "real-time owner notification" tomorrow, what do you have left?
**答案/Answer**: Pre-action routing、learning loop、面向dev teams而非enterprise。Rubrik DNA是backup，目标客户是大企业Salesforce/Copilot Studio。/ Pre-action routing, learning loop, dev team focus vs enterprise. Rubrik's DNA is backup; their target is enterprise Salesforce/Copilot Studio.

**答案/Answer**: 第一步：查日志/Datadog找发生了什么。第二步：在Slack找人/问谁负责。我们要让第二步瞬间完成。/ First: check logs/Datadog for what happened. Second: scramble in Slack to find who's responsible. We make step two instant.

34.	今天他们"找人"的路径是什么？Slack？PagerDuty？Git blame？Runbook？
What's their path to "finding people" today? Slack? PagerDuty? Git blame? Runbook?
**答案/Answer**: 混合且低效：Slack问人、git blame、查过期的runbook、PagerDuty找on-call（但on-call不懂agent）。/ Mixed and inefficient: ask in Slack, git blame, check outdated runbooks, PagerDuty for on-call (but on-call doesn't understand agents).

35.	今天他们"复盘"怎么做？谁写？写什么？存在哪？
How do they do postmortems today? Who writes? What? Where stored?
**答案/Answer**: SRE或涉事团队写，存在Confluence/Notion里积灰。很少被执行，更少被用于防止重复。/ SRE or involved team writes, stored in Confluence/Notion gathering dust. Rarely executed, even more rarely used to prevent repeats.

36.	今天他们怎么避免重复事故？靠制度、靠人、靠 tooling？
How do they prevent repeat incidents today? Process, people, or tooling?
**答案/Answer**: 主要靠人的记忆和口口相传。没有系统性学习机制。这是我们learning loop的切入点。/ Mainly relying on human memory and word of mouth. No systematic learning mechanism. This is our learning loop's entry point.

37.	你的系统能替换他们今天的哪一个动作？
What action of theirs can your system replace today?

39.	你的系统"最先"要接入 MCP？还是接入日志/trace？还是接入 chat？
Should you integrate MCP first, logs/trace, or chat?
**答案/Answer**: MCP优先——这是最精确的agent action数据源。其次Slack/chat用于通知输出。/ MCP first—it's the most precise source of agent action data. Then Slack/chat for notification output.

40.	你的目标用户是 AI platform team 还是 SRE team？冲突时听谁？
Is your target user the AI platform team or SRE team? Who wins in conflicts?
**答案/Answer**: AI platform team优先——他们控制agent deployment，是变化的源头。SRE是受益者但不是primary owner。/ AI platform team first—they control agent deployment, they're the source of change. SRE benefits but isn't primary owner.

**答案/Answer**: Service graph（from OTel/service mesh）+ Ownership graph（from CODEOWNERS/CMDB）。Action hit service A → A depends on B,C → notify owners of A,B,C。/ Service graph (from OTel/service mesh) + Ownership graph (from CODEOWNERS/CMDB). Action hit service A → A depends on B,C → notify owners of A,B,C.

152.	你是否需要 service graph？怎么构建？从哪里拿数据？
Do you need a service graph? How do you build it? Where do you get data?
**答案/Answer**: 需要但不自建。数据源：客户现有service mesh、OTel topology、CMDB。我们消费不创造——service catalog是客户责任。/ Need but don't build ourselves. Data sources: customer's existing service mesh, OTel topology, CMDB. We consume, not create—service catalog is customer's responsibility.

153.	你如何处理微服务依赖变化？
How do you handle microservice dependency changes?
**答案/Answer**: Webhook/polling from service registry、grace period for transitions、flag stale dependencies。微服务变化是常态，系统设计要容忍漂移。/ Webhook/polling from service registry, grace period for transitions, flag stale dependencies. Microservice changes are normal; system design must tolerate drift.

154.	你如何确保你系统本身不会引入安全漏洞？
How do you ensure your system doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities?
**答案/Answer**: 最小权限接入（read-only default）、dependency scanning、SAST/DAST、regular penetration testing（Year 2）、minimal data collection。/ Minimal privilege access (read-only default), dependency scanning, SAST/DAST, regular penetration testing (Year 2), minimal data collection.

155.	你的威胁模型是什么？攻击者是谁？能做什么？
What is your threat model? Who are attackers? What can they do?
**答案/Answer**: 攻击者：恶意内部人、外部攻击者、compromised agent。威胁：数据泄露、虚假归因、服务中断。防护：加密、审计、rate limit、anomaly detection。/ Attackers: malicious insiders, external attackers, compromised agents. Threats: data leak, false attribution, service disruption. Defenses: encryption, audit, rate limit, anomaly detection.

156.	你如何防止内部人篡改归因？
How do you prevent insiders from tampering with attribution?
**答案/Answer**: Append-only storage、hash chain、separation of duties（谁能改ownership vs 谁能看events）、audit all admin actions。/ Append-only storage, hash chain, separation of duties (who can change ownership vs who can see events), audit all admin actions.

157.	你如何处理"agent 伪造身份/伪造事件"？
How do you handle "agent forging identity/events"?
**答案/Answer**: 事件需带签名token（agent identity binding）、validate against known agent registry、anomaly detection（unknown agent ID）。/ Events require signed token (agent identity binding), validate against known agent registry, anomaly detection (unknown agent ID).

158.	你如何处理"工具投毒"导致日志本身不可信？
How do you handle "tool poisoning" making logs untrustworthy?
**答案/Answer**: 这是agent security问题（MCP Security Gateway领域）。我们假设输入数据来自trusted source。如果source compromised，归因仍可用但细节不可信。/ This is an agent security problem (MCP Security Gateway domain). We assume input data from trusted source. If source compromised, attribution still works but details untrustworthy.

159.	你的产品是否需要"可信执行环境"或隔离执行？
Does your product need "trusted execution environment" or isolated execution?
**答案/Answer**: 不需要——我们不执行客户代码，只处理event metadata。隔离执行是agent runtime的责任。/ No—we don't execute customer code, only process event metadata. Isolated execution is agent runtime's responsibility.

160.	你如何测试整套系统的 E2E？用什么模拟器？
How do you E2E test the whole system? What simulator do you use?
**答案/Answer**: Event generator模拟agent traffic、fake Slack endpoint验证notifications、scenario-based tests（"incident发生→routing→notification→ack"闭环）。/ Event generator simulates agent traffic, fake Slack endpoint verifies notifications, scenario-based tests ("incident occurs → routing → notification → ack" closed loop).

161.	你如何构造 chaos test？你要验证哪些不变量？
How do you construct chaos tests? What invariants do you verify?
**答案/Answer**: Chaos：network partition、DB slow、Slack API down。不变量：events不丢、notifications eventually delivered、system recovers without data corruption。/ Chaos: network partition, DB slow, Slack API down. Invariants: events not lost, notifications eventually delivered, system recovers without data corruption.

162.	你如何做 SLO？你系统的 SLO 是什么？
How do you do SLO? What are your system's SLOs?
**答案/Answer**: SLO：Availability 99.9%/月、Event ingestion 99.9%、Notification delivery 99.5% within 5s。我们SLA我们控制的，不SLA客户控制的（如MTTR）。/ SLO: Availability 99.9%/month, Event ingestion 99.9%, Notification delivery 99.5% within 5s. We SLA what we control, not what customer controls (like MTTR).

163.	你如何做 on-call（你自己的 on-call）？你如何处理你系统故障？
How do you do on-call (your own)? How do you handle your system failures?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]
E. 竞争与差异化（30） / Competition & Differentiation (30)

164.	Datadog 的 AI Agents Console 你具体看过哪些能力？哪里不足？
What specific capabilities have you seen in Datadog's AI Agents Console? Where does it fall short?
**答案/Answer**: Datadog做AI Agent Monitoring（agent决策路径可视化、工具调用追踪）和LLM Observability。不足：只有visibility governance（看permissions），没有execution governance、没有action routing、没有rollback、没有incident response。/ Datadog does AI Agent Monitoring (agent decision path visualization, tool call tracing) and LLM Observability. Shortcoming: only visibility governance (see permissions), no execution governance, no action routing, no rollback, no incident response.

165.	Rubrik Agent Rewind 你具体看过哪些能力？哪里不足？
What specific capabilities have you seen in Rubrik Agent Rewind? Where does it fall short?
**答案/Answer**: Rubrik做Agent Monitor（自动发现agents、监控活动）、Agent Governance（策略执行）、Agent Rewind（数据快照回滚）。不足：No learning loop、no pre-action routing、blast radius只显示dependency graph不主动通知owners、面向大企业不面向dev teams。/ Rubrik does Agent Monitor (auto-discover agents, monitor activity), Agent Governance (policy enforcement), Agent Rewind (data snapshot rollback). Shortcoming: No learning loop, no pre-action routing, blast radius only shows dependency graph without proactively notifying owners, targets enterprises not dev teams.

166.	你如何证明"他们解决的是错版本"？你用什么证据？
How do you prove "they're solving the wrong version"? What evidence?
**答案/Answer**: 证据：Rubrik逻辑是"出事→rewind数据"，但真实事故中最大问题不是恢复数据而是"不知道找谁、从哪开始"。Datadog只显示发生了什么，不解决"谁该响应"。/ Evidence: Rubrik's logic is "incident → rewind data," but in real incidents the biggest problem isn't data recovery but "not knowing who to call, where to start." Datadog only shows what happened, doesn't solve "who should respond."

167.	在客户看来，"rollback"与"coordination"哪个更愿意买？
From customer's view, are they more willing to buy "rollback" or "coordination"?
**答案/Answer**: Rollback更容易理解和卖（具体功能），但coordination解决更频繁的痛点（每个incident都需要协调，不是每个都需要rollback）。我们要用具体场景教育市场。/ Rollback is easier to understand and sell (concrete feature), but coordination solves more frequent pain (every incident needs coordination, not every one needs rollback). We need to educate market with specific scenarios.

168.	你的产品最像 PagerDuty 还是像 Sentry 还是像 Datadog？
Does your product most resemble PagerDuty, Sentry, or Datadog?
**答案/Answer**: 最像PagerDuty（on-call routing和incident management），但agent-native。不像Sentry（error tracking）或Datadog（observability metrics）。/ Most like PagerDuty (on-call routing and incident management), but agent-native. Unlike Sentry (error tracking) or Datadog (observability metrics).

169.	你如何避免成为 Datadog 的一个 feature？
How do you avoid becoming a Datadog feature?
**答案/Answer**: 专注他们DNA里没有的：pre-action routing、learning loop、跨平台coordination。Datadog DNA是observability，coordination是side feature对他们。/ Focus on what's not in their DNA: pre-action routing, learning loop, cross-platform coordination. Datadog's DNA is observability; coordination would be a side feature for them.

170.	你如何在巨头面前建立护城河？数据？网络效应？集成？流程嵌入？
How do you build moat against giants? Data? Network effects? Integration? Process embedding?
**答案/Answer**: 流程嵌入（成为incident response第一入口）+ 组织知识（ownership graph积累）。数据网络效应弱，但流程习惯一旦形成难迁移。/ Process embedding (become first entry point for incident response) + organizational knowledge (ownership graph accumulation). Data network effects weak, but once process habits form, hard to migrate.

171.	你的护城河建立在"组织知识"上还是"事件数据"上？
Is your moat built on "organizational knowledge" or "event data"?
**答案/Answer**: 组织知识——ownership graph、谁擅长修什么、历史incident pattern。事件数据可导出，组织知识是我们帮客户结构化的私有资产。/ Organizational knowledge—ownership graph, who's good at fixing what, historical incident patterns. Event data is exportable, organizational knowledge is private asset we help customers structure.

172.	你的系统如何积累"谁擅长修什么"的知识？
How does your system accumulate knowledge of "who's good at fixing what"?
**答案/Answer**: Track response patterns：谁响应了、多快解决了、效果如何。长期可建议"上次这类问题Alice解决最快"。从历史学习，不猜测。/ Track response patterns: who responded, how fast resolved, how effective. Long-term can suggest "last time Alice solved this type fastest." Learn from history, don't guess.

173.	如果客户换了团队成员，你的系统价值会下降吗？
If customers change team members, does your system value decrease?
**答案/Answer**: Ownership graph需要更新，但系统不依赖个人记忆。新人来了可以看历史、看谁之前处理过。系统本身是组织记忆。/ Ownership graph needs updating, but system doesn't depend on individual memory. New people can see history, see who handled before. System itself is organizational memory.

174.	你如何处理竞争对手的集成生态更强的问题？
How do you handle competitors having stronger integration ecosystems?
**答案/Answer**: 先做最关键集成（MCP、Slack、PagerDuty）做深做好。生态大战打不过，单点价值可以赢。专注agent-native integrations。/ Do critical integrations (MCP, Slack, PagerDuty) deep and well first. Can't win ecosystem war, can win on single-point value. Focus on agent-native integrations.

175.	你的 wedge 是"agent incident"还是"agent org graph"？哪个更 defensible？
Is your wedge "agent incident" or "agent org graph"? Which is more defensible?
**答案/Answer**: Agent incident是切入点（紧迫、高频），agent org graph是护城河（一旦建立难迁移）。先用incident获客，用org graph留存。/ Agent incident is entry point (urgent, frequent), agent org graph is moat (once built, hard to migrate). Use incident to acquire, use org graph to retain.

176.	你是否需要开源一部分？开源哪部分？为什么？
Do you need to open source a part? Which part? Why?
**答案/Answer**: 可考虑开源agent SDK/hooks（降低集成门槛）。不开源核心routing engine和org graph。开源是分发策略不是防护策略。/ Can consider open sourcing agent SDK/hooks (lower integration barrier). Don't open source core routing engine and org graph. Open source is distribution strategy, not defense strategy.

177.	你是否计划做插件生态？插件解决什么？
Do you plan a plugin ecosystem? What do plugins solve?
**答案/Answer**: 未来可做：custom notification channels、custom classification rules、custom recovery action triggers。插件扩展边缘能力，核心逻辑不插件化。/ Future potential: custom notification channels, custom classification rules, custom recovery action triggers. Plugins extend edge capabilities, core logic not pluginized.

178.	你如何避免变成"通用工作流引擎"？
How do you avoid becoming a "general workflow engine"?
**答案/Answer**: Scope guard：每个feature必须reduce TTI、improve attribution accuracy、或accelerate learning loop。如果都不是→不做。/ Scope guard: every feature must reduce TTI, improve attribution accuracy, or accelerate learning loop. If none → don't build.

179.	你如何避免 scope creep：从 routing 扩到 approvals 再扩到 everything？
How do you avoid scope creep: from routing to approvals to everything?
**答案/Answer**: 明确"不做清单"：不做pre-approval、不做审批流、不做centralized control。定期review roadmap对比核心定位。说不的能力。/ Clear "not-do list": no pre-approval, no approval workflow, no centralized control. Regularly review roadmap against core positioning. Ability to say no.

180.	你未来 12 个月路线图里，哪一步会让竞争对手追不上？
In your 12-month roadmap, which step makes competitors unable to catch up?
**答案/Answer**: Learning loop + cross-customer pattern library（匿名化后跨客户学习incident patterns）。这需要客户基数和数据积累，早做先占。/ Learning loop + cross-customer pattern library (anonymized cross-customer incident pattern learning). This needs customer base and data accumulation, early mover advantage.
F. 商业模式与定价（35） / Business Model & Pricing (35)

181.	你说按"agent monitored + action routed"计费：agent 怎么计数？按运行实例？按身份？按并发？
You mentioned billing by "agent monitored + action routed": how do you count agents? By running instance? By identity? By concurrency?
**答案/Answer**: 按agent身份（unique agent ID）计数，不按实例或并发。短命任务agent按月活跃去重计。/ Count by agent identity (unique agent ID), not by instance or concurrency. Short-lived task agents counted by monthly active dedupe.

182.	"action routed"怎么计数？每次分类算一次？每次通知算一次？
How do you count "action routed"? Each classification counts once? Each notification counts once?
**答案/Answer**: 每次routing decision算一次（action进来→routing engine处理）。同一个action发多个通知只算一次routing。/ Each routing decision counts once (action comes in → routing engine processes). Same action sending multiple notifications counts as one routing.

183.	你如何防止客户通过配置绕开计费？
How do you prevent customers from bypassing billing through configuration?
**答案/Answer**: 计费在ingest层——数据进入就计数。客户可以选择不路由，但数据已经被记录和计费。/ Billing at ingest layer—data entering is counted. Customers can choose not to route, but data is already recorded and billed.

184.	你的成本结构是什么？存储、带宽、计算、支持？
What's your cost structure? Storage, bandwidth, compute, support?
**答案/Answer**: 主要：存储（event data）> 计算（routing engine）> 带宽（notifications）。支持成本应被定价覆盖。目标：compute和storage都随usage线性扩展。/ Main: storage (event data) > compute (routing engine) > bandwidth (notifications). Support cost should be covered by pricing. Target: compute and storage scale linearly with usage.

185.	你是否会被日志存储成本吞噬？
Will you be consumed by log storage costs?
**答案/Answer**: 不会——我们只存metadata不存raw payload。每个action约1KB。10M actions/月≈10GB/月，成本可控。客户要长期存储可pass-through成本。/ No—we only store metadata, not raw payload. Each action ~1KB. 10M actions/month ≈ 10GB/month, cost manageable. Long-term storage can be cost pass-through to customer.

186.	你的 gross margin 目标是多少？为什么？
What's your gross margin target? Why?
**答案/Answer**: 目标70-80%（SaaS标准）。通过最小数据存储、高效routing engine、自动化运维实现。低于70%需要review架构。/ Target 70-80% (SaaS standard). Achieved through minimal data storage, efficient routing engine, automated ops. Below 70% needs architecture review.

187.	你更像 usage-based 还是 seat-based？为什么？
Are you more usage-based or seat-based? Why?
**答案/Answer**: Usage-based（agents + actions）。因为价值与agent活动量直接相关，不是与人数相关。座位制会惩罚协作。/ Usage-based (agents + actions). Because value directly correlates with agent activity, not headcount. Seat-based would penalize collaboration.

188.	如果客户希望 enterprise 固定价，你能给吗？怎么定？
If customers want enterprise fixed pricing, can you offer it? How?
**答案/Answer**: 可以——按年合同、预估用量、给volume discount。公式：基于历史usage × 预期增长 × 折扣系数。包含burst buffer。/ Yes—annual contract, estimated usage, volume discount. Formula: based on historical usage × expected growth × discount factor. Includes burst buffer.

189.	你怎么定价才能对齐价值：按 MTTR 降低、按 outage 避免、按 on-call 工时？
How do you price to align with value: by MTTR reduction, outage avoidance, or on-call hours?
**答案/Answer**: 间接对齐——pricing by usage，value由customer自己算（MTTR改善×incident频率×工程师成本）。我们提供ROI calculator辅助。/ Indirect alignment—price by usage, customers calculate value themselves (MTTR improvement × incident frequency × engineer cost). We provide ROI calculator to help.

190.	你如何为早期客户定价？免费 pilot 的边界是什么？
How do you price for early customers? What's the boundary of free pilots?
**答案/Answer**: 免费pilot：2周、production环境、最多50 agents。Pilot后必须进入付费对话。边界：超过2周或超过50 agents → 付费。/ Free pilot: 2 weeks, production environment, max 50 agents. Must enter payment conversation after pilot. Boundary: over 2 weeks or over 50 agents → paid.

191.	你如何避免被客户当成"实验玩具"白嫖？
How do you avoid being treated as an "experimental toy" for free?
**答案/Answer**: Pilot有明确结束日期、必须接production、有成功标准checklist、pilot结束时有正式review和决策会议。不续则关。/ Pilot has clear end date, must connect production, has success criteria checklist, formal review and decision meeting at pilot end. No renewal = shutdown.

192.	你的付费触发点是什么？接入生产？事件量达到 X？值班人数达到 Y？
What's your payment trigger? Production connection? Event volume X? On-call count Y?
**答案/Answer**: Pilot结束 + 客户确认价值 → 付费。付费后按actual usage计费。不是事件量阈值——价值确认才是触发点。/ Pilot ends + customer confirms value → payment. After payment, bill by actual usage. Not event volume threshold—value confirmation is the trigger.

193.	你如何做 land-and-expand？先卖哪个团队？再扩到哪里？
How do you land-and-expand? Which team first? Expand where?
**答案/Answer**: Land：AI Platform team或SRE（agent部署最多的团队）。Expand：→ 其他有agents的teams → 跨部门 → 全公司标准化。/ Land: AI Platform team or SRE (team with most agent deployments). Expand: → other teams with agents → cross-department → company-wide standardization.

194.	你预计客户续费看什么指标？
What metrics do you expect drive customer renewals?
**答案/Answer**: TTI改善、重复incident减少、on-call工程师满意度（survey）、routing准确率。核心：客户是否在真实incident中依赖我们。/ TTI improvement, repeat incident reduction, on-call engineer satisfaction (survey), routing accuracy. Core: whether customers rely on us in real incidents.

195.	你预计客户流失的 top 3 原因是什么？
What are your expected top 3 churn reasons?
**答案/Answer**: 1) 太多噪音被静音 2) Ownership data不准导致routing失效 3) Agent部署减少（公司转向非agent方案）。/ 1) Too much noise gets muted 2) Inaccurate ownership data causes routing failure 3) Agent deployment decreases (company shifts away from agents).

196.	你如何定价让客户"越用越离不开"但又不会因为贵而砍掉？
How do you price so customers "can't live without it" but won't cut due to cost?
**答案/Answer**: Volume discount让增长便宜、核心功能包含在base价格、让ownership graph成为组织资产（迁移成本高）。价值>成本感知。/ Volume discount makes growth cheaper, core features included in base price, make ownership graph an organizational asset (high migration cost). Value > perceived cost.

197.	你如何处理小客户（10 agents）与大客户（10k agents）差异？
How do you handle differences between small customers (10 agents) and large customers (10k agents)?
**答案/Answer**: 自助服务tier给小客户（低touch、标准功能）、enterprise tier给大客户（dedicated support、custom SLA、on-prem option）。产品同一套，服务级别不同。/ Self-service tier for small (low-touch, standard features), enterprise tier for large (dedicated support, custom SLA, on-prem option). Same product, different service levels.

198.	你是否需要按环境收费（prod/staging）？
Do you need to charge by environment (prod/staging)?
**答案/Answer**: 只收production。Staging/dev环境免费或大幅折扣——鼓励客户先在staging试用，降低采用门槛。/ Only charge production. Staging/dev environments free or heavily discounted—encourage customers to try in staging first, lower adoption barrier.

199.	你是否需要按数据保留期收费？
Do you need to charge by data retention period?
**答案/Answer**: 基础保留（90天hot + 1年warm）包含。超过1年的cold storage按存储成本pass-through。合规驱动的长期保留是额外计费。/ Base retention (90 days hot + 1 year warm) included. Cold storage over 1 year billed as storage cost pass-through. Compliance-driven long-term retention is additional billing.

200.	你是否需要按合规模块收费（审计导出、审批记录、不可抵赖）？
Do you need to charge by compliance modules (audit export, approval records, non-repudiation)?
**答案/Answer**: Enterprise tier包含合规功能。不单独拆卖——合规客户通常是大客户，打包进enterprise tier。避免复杂定价。/ Enterprise tier includes compliance features. Don't sell separately—compliance customers are usually large, bundle into enterprise tier. Avoid complex pricing.

What's your minimum viable demo? Do you have it now?
**答案/Answer**: Agent发起action → 系统捕获 → 2秒内通知affected owner到Slack。最小闭环演示路由价值。/ Agent initiates action → system captures → notifies affected owner on Slack within 2 seconds. Minimum closed loop demonstrating routing value.

230.	你没有用户，你怎么知道这是痛点不是幻觉？
You have no users. How do you know this is real pain, not a fantasy?
**答案/Answer**: 市场验证：Rubrik和Datadog都在做agent governance产品，说明问题是真实的。我们解决的是他们没解决的版本。/ Market validation: Rubrik and Datadog both building agent governance products, proving the problem is real. We solve the version they don't.

231.	你说"谁做了什么、谁该被通知"，你怎么拿到这两个事实？
You say "who did what, who should be notified"—how do you get these two facts?
**答案/Answer**: 谁做了什么：从MCP hooks/agent SDK获取action+actor。谁该被通知：从ownership graph（CODEOWNERS+CMDB+客户配置）获取。/ Who did what: from MCP hooks/agent SDK get action+actor. Who to notify: from ownership graph (CODEOWNERS+CMDB+customer config).

232.	你不做 pre-approval，那你怎么避免出大事故？
You don't do pre-approval. How do you avoid major incidents?
**答案/Answer**: 不是不阻止错误，是错误发生后人能最快响应。Pre-approval阻止不了真正危险的错误（那些事前无法识别的）。快速发现+快速介入>预防幻觉。/ Not about not preventing errors, but fastest human response when errors occur. Pre-approval can't stop truly dangerous errors (those unidentifiable beforehand). Fast detection + fast intervention > prevention illusion.

233.	你说"intervene at agent speed"，今天 agent speed 是多少？人的 speed 是多少？差距是多少？
You say "intervene at agent speed." What's agent speed today? Human speed? The gap?
**答案/Answer**: Agent：秒级执行（一个action <1秒）。人类发现问题：分钟到小时级（取决于监控覆盖）。人类找人介入：10-30分钟（这是我们缩短的）。/ Agent: seconds per execution (<1s per action). Humans discovering issues: minutes to hours (depends on monitoring). Humans finding someone to intervene: 10-30 minutes (this is what we shorten).

234.	你的产品把"人的介入"加速了哪一步？
Which step of "human intervention" does your product accelerate?
**答案/Answer**: "找谁来介入"这一步——从花10-30分钟变成系统自动2秒内通知正确的人。/ The "finding who to intervene" step—from spending 10-30 minutes to system automatically notifying the right person within 2 seconds.

235.	事故发生时，你的系统第一条消息发给谁？为什么是他？
When an incident happens, who does your system message first? Why them?
**答案/Answer**: Affected resource的owner（根据ownership graph）。为什么：他最了解这个系统、最有权限修、最能判断严重性。/ The affected resource's owner (per ownership graph). Why: they know this system best, have most permissions to fix, can best judge severity.

236.	你怎么证明你发给的是对的人？
How do you prove you're messaging the right person?
**答案/Answer**: 追踪response rate和resolution time。如果routing到的人能快速resolve，说明是对的人。如果频繁escalate，说明规则需要调整。/ Track response rate and resolution time. If routed person resolves quickly, they're the right person. If frequent escalation, rules need adjustment.

237.	如果发错了，代价是什么？谁承担？
If you message the wrong person, what's the cost? Who bears it?
**答案/Answer**: 代价：延迟响应（几分钟）、打扰错误的人。我们承担：通过提供easy escalation、学习错误改进规则。不会比今天手动找人更糟。/ Cost: delayed response (minutes), disturbing wrong person. We bear it: by providing easy escalation, learning from mistakes to improve rules. Won't be worse than manual searching today.

238.	你的系统会不会让事故更糟？举一个你会造成的新 failure mode。
Could your system make incidents worse? Give a new failure mode you might cause.
**答案/Answer**: 可能的failure mode：通知风暴让人desensitized→静音所有通知→真正重要的事被忽略。应对：aggressive aggregation、risk tiering、noise tracking。/ Possible failure mode: notification storm desensitizes people → mute all → truly important things ignored. Counter: aggressive aggregation, risk tiering, noise tracking.

239.	你如何避免自己成为 P0 事故里的单点故障？
How do you avoid becoming a single point of failure in P0 incidents?
**答案/Answer**: 多渠道fallback（Slack+Email+SMS）、本地缓存关键数据、降级模式。我们是加速器不是阻断器——没有我们客户仍能救火，只是慢。/ Multi-channel fallback (Slack+Email+SMS), local cache of critical data, degradation mode. We're an accelerator not a blocker—without us customers can still respond, just slower.

240.	你要是挂了，客户怎么继续救火？
If you're down, how do customers continue fighting fires?
**答案/Answer**: 回退到原有流程：查日志、Slack问人、PagerDuty原有on-call。他们不会比接入我们之前更糟，只是失去加速。/ Fall back to original process: check logs, ask in Slack, PagerDuty original on-call. They won't be worse than before using us, just lose the acceleration.

241.	你需要客户改他们的流程吗？如果要，为什么他们愿意？
Do you need customers to change their processes? If so, why would they?
**答案/Answer**: 最小改变：加一个MCP hook、配置ownership mapping。流程不变——incident仍然照旧处理，只是更快找到人。愿意因为：降低on-call痛苦。/ Minimal change: add an MCP hook, configure ownership mapping. Process unchanged—incidents still handled as before, just find people faster. Willing because: reduces on-call pain.

242.	你需要客户改他们的代码吗？如果要，改哪？
Do you need customers to change their code? If so, where?
**答案/Answer**: Agent runtime加MCP hook（几行代码）。不改业务代码。可提供SDK wrapper让集成更简单。/ Add MCP hook to agent runtime (few lines of code). No business code changes. Can provide SDK wrapper to simplify integration.

243.	你需要客户把什么敏感数据给你？为什么必须？
What sensitive data do you need from customers? Why is it necessary?
**答案/Answer**: Action metadata（tool name, timestamp, actor ID），不需要raw payload。为什么必须：没有"谁做了什么"就无法routing。我们最小化数据收集。/ Action metadata (tool name, timestamp, actor ID), NOT raw payload. Why necessary: can't route without "who did what." We minimize data collection.

244.	你如何过 security review？你准备好 SOC2 了吗？
How do you pass security review? Are you ready for SOC2?
**答案/Answer**: SOC2是Year 2目标。现在：最小数据收集、TLS加密、row-level tenant isolation、audit logs。Security review checklist我们可以提供。/ SOC2 is Year 2 goal. Now: minimal data collection, TLS encryption, row-level tenant isolation, audit logs. We can provide security review checklist.

245.	你觉得谁会最强烈反对你接入生产？
Who will most strongly oppose connecting you to production?
**答案/Answer**: Security team——担心新的攻击面和数据泄露。其次Legal/Compliance——担心数据处理责任。/ Security team—worried about new attack surface and data leak. Then Legal/Compliance—worried about data handling liability.

246.	你怎么说服他们？
How do you convince them?
**答案/Answer**: Security：展示最小数据收集清单、read-only架构、支持BYOK。Compliance：提供DPA、数据处理协议、审计导出能力。/ Security: show minimal data collection list, read-only architecture, BYOK support. Compliance: provide DPA, data processing agreement, audit export capability.

247.	你为什么认为 Datadog/Rubrik做错了？你有证据吗？
Why do you think Datadog/Rubrik got it wrong? Do you have evidence?
**答案/Answer**: 证据：他们的产品设计显示假设错误。Rubrik假设问题是"恢复数据"，但真问题是"不知道找谁"。Datadog假设问题是"看不见"，但真问题是"看见了不知道谁该响应"。/ Evidence: their product design shows wrong assumptions. Rubrik assumes problem is "data recovery," but real problem is "not knowing who to call." Datadog assumes problem is "not seeing," but real problem is "seeing but not knowing who should respond."

248.	你是否愿意把"他们做对的部分"承认出来？是什么？
Are you willing to admit "what they got right"? What is it?
**答案/Answer**: 对的：Rubrik认识到agent会造成破坏需要恢复能力。Datadog认识到agent行为需要可见性。错的：他们停在了这里，没解决协调问题。/ Right: Rubrik recognizes agents cause damage needing recovery capability. Datadog recognizes agent behavior needs visibility. Wrong: they stopped there, didn't solve coordination.

249.	你的 wedge 场景是什么？一句话讲清楚。
What's your wedge scenario? Explain in one sentence.
**答案/Answer**: Agent执行了一个action，5秒内正确的人被通知到并能看到发生了什么。/ Agent executes an action, the right person is notified and can see what happened within 5 seconds.

250.	你的 wedge 场景里，用户现在用什么解决？
In your wedge scenario, what do users use to solve it today?
**答案/Answer**: Slack问人、git blame、查过期runbook、打电话问"谁负责这个"。平均10-30分钟找到对的人。/ Ask in Slack, git blame, check outdated runbooks, call asking "who owns this." Average 10-30 minutes to find the right person.

251.	他们为什么今天不自建？
Why don't they build it themselves today?
**答案/Answer**: 自建需要：维护ownership graph、建routing engine、做Slack集成、处理edge cases。投入大、非核心业务、不划算。他们宁愿忍受也不想分心。/ Building requires: maintaining ownership graph, building routing engine, Slack integration, handling edge cases. High investment, non-core, not worth it. They'd rather tolerate than get distracted.

252.	你的"第一批客户"是谁？你认识多少个？
Who are your "first customers"? How many do you know?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

253.	你过去两周和多少潜在客户聊过？

**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

255.	你如果今天必须拿到一个 pilot，你会怎么拿？
If you had to get a pilot today, how would you do it?
**答案/Answer**: 找到一个正在部署agents、最近遭遇过agent-related incident、且有清晰owner的团队。提供2周免费pilot、承诺hands-on支持、明确成功标准。/ Find a team deploying agents, recently experienced agent-related incident, with clear ownership. Offer 2-week free pilot, commit to hands-on support, define success criteria.

256.	你会怎么定 pilot 的成功标准？
How would you define pilot success criteria?
**答案/Answer**: 1) 至少一次真实incident中使用系统 2) Routing到正确的人 3) 客户说"this saved me X minutes"。定性+定量结合。/ 1) Used in at least one real incident 2) Routed to correct person 3) Customer says "this saved me X minutes." Qualitative + quantitative combined.

257.	你愿意免费做多久？为什么？
How long are you willing to be free? Why?
**答案/Answer**: 2周pilot免费。超过2周必须进入付费讨论——避免被当成免费工具。免费时间换验证，不是换用户数量。/ 2-week pilot free. Beyond 2 weeks must enter payment discussion—avoid being treated as free tool. Free time for validation, not user count.

258.	你愿意为一个大客户做定制吗？到什么程度？
Are you willing to customize for a big customer? To what extent?
**答案/Answer**: 愿意做：集成他们特殊系统、定制routing规则、定制notification格式。不愿意做：改变核心产品逻辑、做one-off features。/ Willing: integrate their special systems, customize routing rules, customize notification format. Unwilling: change core product logic, build one-off features.

259.	你如何避免被 enterprise 定制拖死？
How do you avoid being killed by enterprise customization?
**答案/Answer**: Scope guard：每个定制必须能变成产品feature或可配置选项。纯one-off说不。保持mid-market focus，避免追逐mega-deals。/ Scope guard: every customization must become a product feature or configurable option. Say no to pure one-offs. Keep mid-market focus, avoid chasing mega-deals.

260.	你一人开发，8–12 周能交付什么？按周拆解。
As a solo dev, what can you deliver in 8-12 weeks? Break down by week.
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

261.	你最担心你做不出来的部分是哪块？为什么？
Which part are you most worried you can't build? Why?
**答案/Answer**: Ownership graph的冷启动——需要客户配置大量映射数据。应对：提供import from CODEOWNERS/CMDB、渐进式onboarding、先从最关键服务开始。/ Ownership graph cold start—requires customer to configure lots of mapping data. Counter: provide import from CODEOWNERS/CMDB, gradual onboarding, start with most critical services first.

262.	你缺的不是技术，是分发还是信任？
You don't lack tech. Do you lack distribution or trust?
**答案/Answer**: 信任——作为新产品，客户凭什么把agent数据给我。应对：pilot验证、参考客户testimonials、transparent architecture documentation。/ Trust—as a new product, why would customers give me agent data. Counter: pilot validation, reference customer testimonials, transparent architecture documentation.

263.	如果明天开源社区做出一个同类项目，你怎么办？
If an open source community builds something similar tomorrow, what do you do?
**答案/Answer**: 继续做——开源解决tool问题，不解决服务问题（托管、维护、支持）。我们价值是managed service + 持续迭代 + 跨客户学习。/ Keep going—open source solves tool problems, not service problems (hosting, maintenance, support). Our value is managed service + continuous iteration + cross-customer learning.

264.	你的护城河是数据、网络效应还是流程嵌入？只能选一个。
Is your moat data, network effects, or process embedding? Choose only one.
**答案/Answer**: 流程嵌入——成为incident response第一入口、组织的ownership knowledge积累在我们这里。一旦习惯形成，迁移成本高。/ Process embedding—become first entry point for incident response, organization's ownership knowledge accumulates with us. Once habits form, migration cost is high.

265.	你怎么在 3 个月内建立这个护城河？
How do you build this moat in 3 months?
**答案/Answer**: 让几个pilot客户把我们作为incident first responder、帮他们建完整ownership graph、让postmortem数据积累在我们系统。3个月后迁移意味着丢失组织知识。/ Get a few pilot customers to use us as incident first responder, help them build complete ownership graph, let postmortem data accumulate in our system. Migrating after 3 months means losing organizational knowledge.
266.	你如何定价？你的价值单位是什么？
How do you price? What's your unit of value?
**答案/Answer**: 按agents monitored + actions routed。价值单位是"能多快找到对的人"——本质是时间和协调成本的节约。/ By agents monitored + actions routed. Unit of value is "how fast can you find the right person"—essentially time and coordination cost savings.

267.	你怎么定义"一个 agent"？
How do you define "one agent"?
**答案/Answer**: Unique agent identity（注册时获得的ID）。同一identity的多个实例算一个agent。短命任务agent按月活跃去重计数。/ Unique agent identity (ID obtained at registration). Multiple instances of same identity count as one agent. Short-lived task agents counted by monthly active deduplication.

268.	如果客户说"我有 1000 个 agent，但都是短命任务"，你怎么收费？
If customer says "I have 1000 agents but all short-lived tasks," how do you charge?
**答案/Answer**: 按月活跃agent ID计数，不按实例。1000个短命任务但只有100个unique identities = 按100个收费。合理公平。/ Count by monthly active agent IDs, not instances. 1000 short-lived tasks but only 100 unique identities = charge for 100. Fair and reasonable.

269.	你成本的最大头是什么？日志？存储？带宽？计算？
What's your biggest cost? Logs? Storage? Bandwidth? Compute?
**答案/Answer**: 存储（event data长期保留）> 计算（routing engine和API）> 带宽（notifications外发）。存储是增长最快的成本。/ Storage (event data long-term retention) > compute (routing engine and API) > bandwidth (outbound notifications). Storage is the fastest-growing cost.

270.	你怎么保证毛利？
How do you ensure gross margin?
**答案/Answer**: 最小化存储（只存metadata不存payload）、高效routing engine、自动化运维。目标毛利70-80%。低于70%需要review架构。/ Minimize storage (store metadata only, not payload), efficient routing engine, automated ops. Target margin 70-80%. Below 70% needs architecture review.

271.	你要做到多大才是一个大公司？
How big do you need to get to be a big company?
**答案/Answer**: $100M ARR是里程碑。按ARPA $50K需要2000客户。按大客户ARPA $200K需要500客户。市场足够大。/ $100M ARR is the milestone. At ARPA $50K need 2000 customers. At large customer ARPA $200K need 500 customers. Market is big enough.

272.	你怎么避免这个市场只是短期 hype？
How do you avoid this market being just short-term hype?
**答案/Answer**: Agent adoption已在发生（Cursor、Claude Code、企业agents）。即使hype消退，已部署的agents仍需要governance。问题只会变大不会变小。/ Agent adoption is already happening (Cursor, Claude Code, enterprise agents). Even if hype fades, deployed agents still need governance. Problem only grows, doesn't shrink.

273.	如果 agent adoption 没发生，你公司就死了吗？
If agent adoption doesn't happen, does your company die?
**答案/Answer**: 会严重影响，但核心能力（routing + ownership graph + coordination）可以应用于任何automated system，不只是AI agents。Pivot空间存在。/ Would seriously impact, but core capabilities (routing + ownership graph + coordination) apply to any automated system, not just AI agents. Pivot space exists.

274.	你现在最需要 YC 帮你的是什么？
What do you most need YC to help you with right now?
**答案/Answer**: 1) 早期客户intro（YC网络中deploying agents的公司）2) GTM guidance（B2B infra的销售节奏）3) 招聘credibility（吸引第一个核心工程师）。/ 1) Early customer intros (companies deploying agents in YC network) 2) GTM guidance (B2B infra sales cadence) 3) Hiring credibility (attract first core engineer).

275.	如果 YC 不收你，你下个月会做什么不同？
If YC doesn't accept you, what will you do differently next month?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

276.	你为什么是 solo founder？
Why are you a solo founder?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

277.	你什么时候会找 cofounder？触发条件是什么？
When will you look for a cofounder? What's the trigger?

**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

280.	你是愿意当 CEO 还是当 CTO？
Would you rather be CEO or CTO?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

281.	你如何证明你不是"看了 xAI 视频才想到"这个点子？
How do you prove you didn't just think of this idea from watching xAI videos?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

282.	你在这个方向上有没有自己亲身的生产事故经历？
Do you have personal production incident experience in this direction?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

283.	你有没有做过一个系统被用户依赖的东西？例子是什么？
Have you built something users depended on? What's an example?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

284.	你最大的执行优势是什么？
What's your biggest execution advantage?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

285.	你最大的 blind spot 是什么？
What's your biggest blind spot?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

286.	你最可能被拒的原因是什么？你怎么提前修正？
What's the most likely reason you'll be rejected? How do you pre-correct?
**答案/Answer**: 最可能原因：没有用户/pilot。修正：YC面试前尽可能拿到一个pilot承诺或design partner。展示执行力不只是想法。/ Most likely reason: no users/pilot. Correction: get a pilot commitment or design partner before YC interview. Show execution, not just ideas.

287.	你最强的一句"反对者也难反驳"的论点是什么？
What's your strongest argument that even critics can't refute?
**答案/Answer**: 真正的生产事故中，最大问题不是不能修，而是不知道找谁——这是任何有on-call经验的人都承认的事实。/ In real production incidents, the biggest problem isn't inability to fix, but not knowing who to call—a fact anyone with on-call experience admits.

288.	你能否用一句话解释：为什么"rollback 是社会能力"？
Can you explain in one sentence: why is "rollback a social capability"?
**答案/Answer**: 因为rollback的核心资源不是存储或checkpoint，而是"谁知道怎么补救"和"谁愿意补救"——这是人的协调问题。/ Because rollback's core resource isn't storage or checkpoints, but "who knows how to fix" and "who's willing to fix"—that's a human coordination problem.

289.	你如何把"社会能力"产品化？
How do you productize "social capability"?
**答案/Answer**: 把隐性知识（谁负责什么、谁擅长什么）变成显性ownership graph。把协调流程（找人、通知、escalation）变成自动化routing。/ Turn implicit knowledge (who's responsible for what, who's good at what) into explicit ownership graph. Turn coordination process (finding people, notifying, escalation) into automated routing.

290.	你怎么衡量社会能力被提升了？
How do you measure that social capability improved?
**答案/Answer**: TTI（从发现问题到对的人开始处理的时间）、首次routing命中率、escalation频率下降。这些是协调效率的proxy指标。/ TTI (time from problem discovery to right person starting to handle), first routing hit rate, escalation frequency decrease. These are proxy metrics for coordination efficiency.

291.	你怎么把"who to call"从经验主义变成系统主义？
How do you turn "who to call" from experiential to systematic?
**答案/Answer**: 把组织记忆（在谁脑子里）变成ownership graph（在系统里）。规则化routing（基于resource type + risk level）取代临时问人。/ Turn organizational memory (in someone's head) into ownership graph (in system). Rule-based routing (based on resource type + risk level) replaces ad-hoc asking.

292.	你怎么避免你的系统把组织政治带进来？
How do you avoid bringing organizational politics into your system?
**答案/Answer**: Attribution标记"involved"不是"guilty"。Blameless mode可用。Postmortem focus on process不是person。展示facts不assign fault。/ Attribution marks "involved" not "guilty." Blameless mode available. Postmortem focuses on process not person. Show facts, don't assign fault.

293.	你怎么处理"责任归属"带来的冲突？
How do you handle conflicts from "responsibility attribution"?
**答案/Answer**: 双方看同一数据源、shared channel讨论。系统记录facts不judge。冲突解决是组织的事，我们提供共同事实基础。/ Both sides see same data source, discuss in shared channel. System records facts, doesn't judge. Conflict resolution is organization's job; we provide common factual basis.

294.	你的系统会不会变成"甩锅工具"？
Could your system become a "blame-shifting tool"?
**答案/Answer**: 可能被滥用。防护：默认blameless mode、attribution显示"involved"而非cause、强调process failure而非individual failure。文化引导。/ Could be misused. Protection: default blameless mode, attribution shows "involved" not cause, emphasize process failure not individual failure. Cultural guidance.

295.	你如何设计，让它更像"救火工具"不是"问责工具"？
How do you design it to be more like a "firefighting tool" than an "accountability tool"?
**答案/Answer**: 实时routing和通知是主功能（救火）。Postmortem是事后可选（学习）。UI强调"how to fix"而非"who caused"。默认隐藏个人identity可配置。/ Real-time routing and notification are main features (firefighting). Postmortem is optional post-hoc (learning). UI emphasizes "how to fix" not "who caused." Default hide personal identity, configurable.

296.	你如何处理"错误归因导致的人事问题"？
How do you handle "HR issues caused by wrong attribution"?
**答案/Answer**: 明确声明：Attribution是"involved in event chain"不是"caused the problem"。系统不做判断，只呈现时间线和关联。使用责任由客户承担。/ Clear statement: Attribution means "involved in event chain" not "caused the problem." System doesn't judge, only presents timeline and associations. Usage responsibility is customer's.

297.	你如何处理"合规要求保存证据"与"文化不想被监控"的矛盾？
How do you handle the conflict between "compliance requires evidence retention" and "culture doesn't want monitoring"?
**答案/Answer**: 透明度：明确告诉员工什么被记录、为什么、谁能访问。最小数据收集。Access control让只有必要的人能看。合规和隐私可以共存。/ Transparency: clearly tell employees what's recorded, why, who can access. Minimal data collection. Access control so only necessary people can see. Compliance and privacy can coexist.

298.	你如何让工程师愿意接入你，而不是抵触？
How do you make engineers willing to connect you, not resist?
**答案/Answer**: 强调对on-call的好处（减少被打扰、更快定位问题）而非监控。让工程师自己看到价值（"这救了我30分钟"）。从愿意的团队开始，口碑扩散。/ Emphasize on-call benefits (less interruption, faster problem location) not monitoring. Let engineers see value themselves ("this saved me 30 minutes"). Start with willing teams, spread by word of mouth.

299.	你如何减少打扰，让 on-call 愿意用你？
How do you reduce disturbance so on-call is willing to use you?
**答案/Answer**: 风险分级（高风险立即通知，低风险批量）、quiet hours、智能聚合、可调阈值。追踪noise-to-signal ratio，持续优化。目标是更少打扰不是更多。/ Risk tiering (high-risk immediate, low-risk batched), quiet hours, smart aggregation, adjustable thresholds. Track noise-to-signal ratio, continuously optimize. Goal is less disturbance, not more.

300.	你系统的"最危险操作"是什么？你怎么加护栏？
What's the "most dangerous operation" in your system? How do you add guardrails?
**答案/Answer**: 最危险：routing rule配错导致重要通知发给错误的人或没发。护栏：rule testing（against historical data）、dry-run mode、change review、rule audit log。/ Most dangerous: routing rule misconfigured sending important notifications to wrong person or not at all. Guardrails: rule testing (against historical data), dry-run mode, change review, rule audit log.

301.	你如果把护栏做强，会不会变回审批系统？怎么避免？
If you strengthen guardrails, will you become an approval system? How to avoid?
**答案/Answer**: 护栏是防止配置错误，不是防止agent执行。区分：rule config change需要review ≠ agent action需要approval。前者合理，后者是我们反对的。/ Guardrails prevent configuration errors, not agent execution. Distinguish: rule config change needs review ≠ agent action needs approval. Former is reasonable, latter is what we oppose.

302.	你如何在"速度"和"安全"之间定边界？
How do you set boundaries between "speed" and "safety"?
**答案/Answer**: 边界：我们提供速度（快速routing、快速通知）。安全是通过快速响应实现的，不是通过阻断实现的。真正的安全=快速发现+快速介入+快速恢复。/ Boundary: we provide speed (fast routing, fast notification). Safety is achieved through fast response, not blocking. Real safety = fast detection + fast intervention + fast recovery.

303.	你如何证明你做的是"基础设施级别"的东西？
How do you prove you're building "infrastructure-level" stuff?
**答案/Answer**: 每个incident都需要协调（who to call）。每个team都需要ownership graph。这是跨场景、跨团队的共性需求，不是某个特定workflow的特性。/ Every incident needs coordination (who to call). Every team needs ownership graph. This is a common need across scenarios and teams, not a specific workflow's feature.

304.	你如何证明这能成为 10B 公司而不是一个小插件？
How do you prove this can become a $10B company, not a small plugin?
**答案/Answer**: PagerDuty $2B+（只做通知和on-call）。我们做agent-native coordination（更深的问题）。Agent adoption只会增加。市场$10B+可期。/ PagerDuty $2B+ (just notifications and on-call). We do agent-native coordination (deeper problem). Agent adoption only grows. $10B+ market achievable.

305.	你最看重的一个指标是什么？为什么？
What's the one metric you care about most? Why?
**答案/Answer**: TTI（Time-to-Intervention）——从问题发生到对的人开始处理的时间。这是我们核心价值的最直接度量：人类跟上agent速度的能力。/ TTI (Time-to-Intervention)—time from problem occurring to right person starting to handle. This is the most direct measure of our core value: humans keeping up with agent speed.
________________________________________
I. 产品核心机制：归因、路由、干预（90） / Product Core Mechanics: Attribution, Routing, Intervention (90)

306.	"归因"的最小粒度是什么：commit、tool call、workflow step、agent run？
What's the minimum granularity of "attribution": commit, tool call, workflow step, or agent run?
**答案/Answer**: Tool call——每个agent tool调用是最小归因单位。可聚合成workflow step或run，但追溯时能到tool call级别。/ Tool call—each agent tool invocation is the minimum attribution unit. Can aggregate to workflow step or run, but traceable to tool call level.

307.	归因必须做到"不可抵赖"吗？如果不，什么时候可以弱化？
Must attribution be non-repudiable? If not, when can it be weakened?
**答案/Answer**: 默认要求不可抵赖（hash chain + timestamp）。可弱化场景：非生产环境、低风险action、客户明确接受弱归因换取性能。/ Default requires non-repudiation (hash chain + timestamp). Can weaken for: non-prod environments, low-risk actions, customer explicitly accepts weak attribution for performance.

308.	你如何处理"一个行动由多个 agent 和人共同造成"？
How do you handle "one action caused by multiple agents and humans together"?
**答案/Answer**: 记录完整事件链，标注所有参与者。归因是"involved"不是"sole cause"。展示时序图让用户看因果关系。/ Record complete event chain, mark all participants. Attribution is "involved" not "sole cause." Show sequence diagram for users to see causal relationships.

309.	你如何处理"agent 使用了一个工具，该工具内部又调用了别的 API"？
How do you handle "agent used a tool that internally called other APIs"?
**答案/Answer**: 追踪深度取决于工具是否instrumented。如果工具有hooks→记录子调用。如果没有→归因到顶层tool call，子调用用infrastructure logs补充。/ Tracking depth depends on whether tool is instrumented. If tool has hooks → record sub-calls. If not → attribute to top-level tool call, supplement sub-calls with infrastructure logs.

310.	你如何处理"agent 通过间接方式造成影响"（例如生成配置导致后续宕机）？
How do you handle "agent causing impact indirectly" (e.g., generating config that causes later crash)?
**答案/Answer**: 时间相关≠因果。记录：agent生成config的action + 后续系统failure。关联但不自动断定因果。人类判断是否相关。/ Time correlation ≠ causation. Record: agent's config generation action + subsequent system failure. Associate but don't auto-determine causation. Humans judge if related.

311.	你如何把"原因"与"责任"分离？
How do you separate "cause" from "responsibility"?
**答案/Answer**: 系统只记录"谁做了什么"（事实），不判断"谁该负责"（判断）。Responsibility assignment是组织决策，不是系统功能。/ System only records "who did what" (facts), doesn't judge "who's responsible" (judgment). Responsibility assignment is organizational decision, not system function.

312.	你如何避免"看起来像责任"的归因其实是相关而非因果？
How do you avoid "attribution that looks like responsibility" being correlation not causation?
**答案/Answer**: 明确UI措辞：用"involved in"而非"caused by"。提供timeline而非blame graph。文档和培训强调时间关联≠因果。/ Clear UI wording: use "involved in" not "caused by." Provide timeline not blame graph. Documentation and training emphasize time correlation ≠ causation.

313.	你如何从事件流推断因果链？
How do you infer causal chains from event streams?
**答案/Answer**: v1不自动推断因果，只提供时序数据。未来可用：1) 显式parent-child关系 2) 时间窗口+资源匹配启发式 3) 用户标注训练。/ v1 doesn't auto-infer causation, only provides temporal data. Future options: 1) explicit parent-child relationships 2) time window + resource matching heuristics 3) user annotation training.

314.	你是否会构建 DAG（依赖图）？节点是什么？边是什么？
Will you build a DAG (dependency graph)? What are nodes? What are edges?
**答案/Answer**: 会构建service dependency graph（from OTel/service mesh）。节点：services。边：调用关系。用于blast radius估算，不用于因果判断。/ Will build service dependency graph (from OTel/service mesh). Nodes: services. Edges: call relationships. Used for blast radius estimation, not causal judgment.

315.	你如何处理循环依赖、并发写入、竞态条件？
How do you handle circular dependencies, concurrent writes, race conditions?
**答案/Answer**: 循环依赖：标记但不阻止展示。并发写入：按ingest time排序、标注不确定性。竞态：记录所有事件，让人类判断哪个先。/ Circular deps: mark but don't block display. Concurrent writes: order by ingest time, note uncertainty. Race: record all events, let humans judge which was first.

316.	你如何把"intervene"定义成可枚举的动作集合？
How do you define "intervene" as an enumerable set of actions?
**答案/Answer**: 核心干预动作：1) View details 2) Acknowledge 3) Escalate 4) Pause agent 5) Trigger webhook 6) Mark resolved。可扩展，但有限集合。/ Core intervention actions: 1) View details 2) Acknowledge 3) Escalate 4) Pause agent 5) Trigger webhook 6) Mark resolved. Extensible but finite set.

317.	你的干预动作里哪些是"可撤销"的？哪些不可撤销？
Which of your intervention actions are "reversible"? Which are irreversible?
**答案/Answer**: 可撤销：Acknowledge、Pause（可resume）、Escalate（可de-escalate）。不可撤销：外部webhook触发的实际系统变更（那不是我们控制的）。/ Reversible: Acknowledge, Pause (can resume), Escalate (can de-escalate). Irreversible: actual system changes triggered by external webhooks (not under our control).

318.	你如何处理不可撤销动作的风险？
How do you handle the risk of irreversible actions?
**答案/Answer**: 我们不执行不可撤销动作——只建议和通知。实际执行是用户在他们系统里做的。风险由执行者承担，不由我们承担。/ We don't execute irreversible actions—only suggest and notify. Actual execution is done by users in their systems. Risk borne by executor, not us.

319.	你如何在不阻塞执行的前提下，仍然在关键点"可介入"？
How do you remain "intervenable" at critical points without blocking execution?
**答案/Answer**: 异步通知+快速响应。关键点标记高风险→立即通知→人可以在agent继续之前介入（如果他们足够快）。不是阻塞等待。/ Async notification + fast response. Critical points marked high-risk → immediate notification → humans can intervene before agent continues (if they're fast enough). Not blocking wait.

320.	你如何定义"关键点"？
How do you define "critical points"?
**答案/Answer**: 基于规则：action type（delete/modify/deploy）+ resource criticality（prod/core service）+ risk score。客户可自定义。关键点=需要立即通知的点。/ Rule-based: action type (delete/modify/deploy) + resource criticality (prod/core service) + risk score. Customer customizable. Critical point = point needing immediate notification.

321.	你如何避免 routing 规则爆炸？
How do you avoid routing rule explosion?
**答案/Answer**: 分层规则：默认规则→team规则→service规则→exception。继承和override。限制规则层级深度。提供规则分析工具检测冲突和冗余。/ Layered rules: default → team rules → service rules → exceptions. Inheritance and override. Limit rule nesting depth. Provide rule analysis tools to detect conflicts and redundancy.

322.	routing 的输入有哪些：action type、resource、env、owner graph、historical incidents？
What are routing inputs: action type, resource, env, owner graph, historical incidents?
**答案/Answer**: 所有都是输入。优先级：action type + resource（决定谁）+ env（决定紧急度）+ owner graph（找到人）+ historical（优化建议）。/ All are inputs. Priority: action type + resource (decide who) + env (decide urgency) + owner graph (find person) + historical (optimize suggestions).

323.	routing 的输出是否需要多级 escalation？怎么设计？
Does routing output need multi-level escalation? How to design?
**答案/Answer**: 需要。设计：Level 1（owner）→ timeout X分钟 → Level 2（backup/manager）→ timeout Y分钟 → Level 3（fallback channel）。客户可配置层级和timeout。/ Yes. Design: Level 1 (owner) → timeout X minutes → Level 2 (backup/manager) → timeout Y minutes → Level 3 (fallback channel). Customers can configure levels and timeouts.

324.	escalation 规则写在哪？由谁维护？
Where are escalation rules written? Who maintains them?
**答案/Answer**: 在我们系统的规则配置UI/YAML中。由客户的Platform team或SRE维护。我们提供模板和最佳实践。规则变更有审计日志。/ In our system's rule config UI/YAML. Maintained by customer's Platform team or SRE. We provide templates and best practices. Rule changes have audit logs.

325.	你如何处理"owner 不在岗"？
How do you handle "owner not available"?
**答案/Answer**: 集成PagerDuty/Opsgenie schedule判断on-call状态。不在岗→自动escalate到backup或on-call rotation。追踪响应时间用于优化。/ Integrate PagerDuty/Opsgenie schedule to determine on-call status. Not available → auto-escalate to backup or on-call rotation. Track response time for optimization.

326.	你如何处理"owner 是离职员工"？
How do you handle "owner is a departed employee"?
**答案/Answer**: Webhook from HR system触发ownership review。标记"owner may be stale"。提示管理员更新ownership。weekly报告无主资源。/ Webhook from HR system triggers ownership review. Flag "owner may be stale." Prompt admin to update ownership. Weekly report on unowned resources.

327.	你如何处理"owner 是外包/供应商"？
How do you handle "owner is outsourcer/vendor"?
**答案/Answer**: 支持external user类型。可配置：external owner只收通知、不能做某些操作。敏感数据可选redact for external。/ Support external user type. Configurable: external owners only receive notifications, can't do certain operations. Sensitive data optionally redacted for external.

328.	你如何处理"没有人愿意接锅"的系统？
How do you handle systems "no one wants to own"?
**答案/Answer**: 强制要求每个service有owner（fallback到admin）。定期报告disputed/unowned resources。鼓励但不强制——最终是组织文化问题。/ Require every service to have an owner (fallback to admin). Regular reports on disputed/unowned resources. Encourage but don't force—ultimately an organizational culture issue.

329.	你如何处理"组织结构和服务图不一致"？
How do you handle "org structure and service graph inconsistent"?
**答案/Answer**: Ownership graph独立于org chart。Service ownership可以跨team。我们消费客户定义的ownership，不假设它必须匹配org chart。/ Ownership graph independent of org chart. Service ownership can span teams. We consume customer-defined ownership, don't assume it must match org chart.

330.	你如何处理"服务 ownership 模糊"而导致路由无法确定？
How do you handle "unclear service ownership" causing uncertain routing?
**答案/Answer**: 标记"ownership disputed"→通知所有候选owners→创建shared channel讨论。路由到多个人比路由到无人好。人工解决后更新ownership。/ Flag "ownership disputed" → notify all candidate owners → create shared channel for discussion. Routing to multiple people better than routing to none. Update ownership after human resolution.
331.	你如何处理"一个行动影响多个团队但没人看全局"？
How do you handle "one action affecting multiple teams but no one sees the full picture"?
**答案/Answer**: 自动创建cross-team incident channel、通知所有affected owners、提供unified timeline视图。指定incident commander角色看全局。/ Auto-create cross-team incident channel, notify all affected owners, provide unified timeline view. Designate incident commander role to see full picture.

332.	你如何把 incident 从多条事件里聚合出来？聚合窗口是什么？
How do you aggregate incidents from multiple events? What's the aggregation window?
**答案/Answer**: 时间窗口（默认5分钟）+ 相同resource/service + 相同或相关error type。窗口可配置。聚合后一个incident包含多个underlying events。/ Time window (default 5 minutes) + same resource/service + same or related error type. Window configurable. After aggregation, one incident contains multiple underlying events.

333.	你如何区分"正常波动"和"事故"？
How do you distinguish "normal fluctuation" from "incident"?
**答案/Answer**: 我们不做anomaly detection（那是Datadog的事）。我们基于规则：特定action type（delete/fail/error）触发routing。客户定义什么算incident。/ We don't do anomaly detection (that's Datadog's job). We're rule-based: specific action types (delete/fail/error) trigger routing. Customers define what counts as incident.

334.	你是否会引入阈值/统计检测？如果你不想用，替代是什么？
Will you introduce threshold/statistical detection? If not, what's the alternative?
**答案/Answer**: v1不做统计检测——靠规则和显式signals（error codes、failed status）。未来可做简单阈值（>X failures in Y minutes）。复杂ML留给specialized tools。/ v1 no statistical detection—rely on rules and explicit signals (error codes, failed status). Future can do simple thresholds (>X failures in Y minutes). Complex ML left to specialized tools.

335.	你如何处理"慢性事故"（性能逐渐变差）？
How do you handle "chronic incidents" (performance gradually degrading)?
**答案/Answer**: 不是我们的核心场景——那是APM/monitoring的领域。我们处理discrete events。客户可以配置定期性能检查触发我们的routing。/ Not our core scenario—that's APM/monitoring territory. We handle discrete events. Customers can configure periodic performance checks to trigger our routing.

336.	你如何处理"快闪事故"（几秒内发生又恢复）？
How do you handle "flash incidents" (occur and recover within seconds)?
**答案/Answer**: 仍然记录和routing（可配置为低优先级）。快闪≠不重要——可能是早期预警。客户可选择suppress或收集用于pattern detection。/ Still record and route (configurable as low priority). Flash ≠ unimportant—could be early warning. Customers can choose to suppress or collect for pattern detection.

337.	你如何处理"用户体验事故"（指标没变但客户在骂）？
How do you handle "user experience incidents" (metrics unchanged but customers complaining)?
**答案/Answer**: 不是我们的检测范围——需要外部信号（customer support tickets、social media）。可以作为外部事件源接入我们的routing系统。/ Not our detection scope—needs external signals (customer support tickets, social media). Can integrate as external event source into our routing system.

338.	你如何把"影响"量化并展示给需要的人？
How do you quantify and display "impact" to those who need it?
**答案/Answer**: 影响指标：affected services count、estimated users affected（from service graph）、severity level。展示在incident summary和notification中。不自己测量，靠integrated signals。/ Impact metrics: affected services count, estimated users affected (from service graph), severity level. Display in incident summary and notifications. Don't measure ourselves, rely on integrated signals.

339.	你如何把"影响"映射到"谁应该被通知"？
How do you map "impact" to "who should be notified"?
**答案/Answer**: Blast radius estimation → affected services → ownership graph lookup → notify owners。影响越大→通知范围越广→可能escalate到更高级别。/ Blast radius estimation → affected services → ownership graph lookup → notify owners. Larger impact → wider notification scope → may escalate to higher levels.

340.	你如何定义 blast radius 的上界/下界？
How do you define upper/lower bounds of blast radius?
**答案/Answer**: 下界：直接affected resource。上界：从service graph推断的所有downstream dependencies。可配置depth limit防止全公司通知。/ Lower bound: directly affected resource. Upper bound: all downstream dependencies inferred from service graph. Configurable depth limit to prevent company-wide notification.

341.	你如何把"修复路径"做成可行动的建议？
How do you make "recovery path" actionable suggestions?
**答案/Answer**: Structured建议：1) Link to relevant runbook 2) List affected resources 3) Suggest specific action（如rollback to commit X）4) 提供one-click buttons（where safe）。/ Structured suggestions: 1) Link to relevant runbook 2) List affected resources 3) Suggest specific action (e.g., rollback to commit X) 4) Provide one-click buttons (where safe).

342.	你是否会建议"回滚到某个版本"？依据是什么？
Will you suggest "rollback to version X"? Based on what?
**答案/Answer**: 可以建议——依据：incident时间 correlate with recent deploy → 建议rollback to pre-deploy version。只是建议，不自动执行。人决定是否采纳。/ Can suggest—based on: incident time correlates with recent deploy → suggest rollback to pre-deploy version. Just suggestion, don't auto-execute. Human decides whether to adopt.

343.	你是否会建议"禁用某个工具/权限"？依据是什么？
Will you suggest "disable certain tool/permission"? Based on what?
**答案/Answer**: 可以建议——依据：特定tool反复造成问题、风险评估超阈值。建议是"consider reviewing permissions for tool X"，不是直接禁用。/ Can suggest—based on: specific tool repeatedly causing issues, risk score exceeds threshold. Suggestion is "consider reviewing permissions for tool X," not direct disable.

344.	你如何处理"建议错误导致更大损失"的责任？
How do you handle responsibility for "suggestions causing greater loss"?
**答案/Answer**: 明确：我们是advisory，不是executor。用户选择是否采纳建议。TOS明确建议不构成guarantee。类似医疗：医生建议，患者决定。/ Clear: we are advisory, not executor. Users choose whether to adopt suggestions. TOS clearly states suggestions don't constitute guarantees. Like medicine: doctor suggests, patient decides.

345.	你是 advisory 还是执行者？边界在哪里？
Are you advisory or executor? Where's the boundary?
**答案/Answer**: Advisory为主。执行仅限：发送通知、创建channel、标记状态。不执行：实际系统变更（rollback、delete、modify）。边界=是否改变客户生产系统状态。/ Primarily advisory. Execution limited to: sending notifications, creating channels, marking status. Don't execute: actual system changes (rollback, delete, modify). Boundary = whether it changes customer production system state.

346.	你如何处理"用户忽略你的建议"？你还值钱吗？
How do you handle "users ignoring your suggestions"? Are you still valuable?
**答案/Answer**: 仍然有价值：1) 通知本身有价值（知道发生了什么）2) 记录供postmortem 3) 如果频繁忽略后出问题，学习改进建议。价值不只在建议被采纳。/ Still valuable: 1) Notification itself has value (knowing what happened) 2) Record for postmortem 3) If frequently ignored then problems occur, learn to improve suggestions. Value isn't only in suggestion adoption.

347.	你如何让用户形成依赖：每次事故都先看你？
How do you get users dependent: checking you first every incident?
**答案/Answer**: 成为最快知道"发生了什么+该找谁"的地方。比查日志快→成为first stop。积累历史数据→成为唯一看全貌的地方。/ Become the fastest place to know "what happened + who to call." Faster than checking logs → become first stop. Accumulate historical data → become the only place seeing full picture.

348.	你如何把 postmortem 自动生成到什么程度？
To what extent do you auto-generate postmortems?
**答案/Answer**: 自动生成：timeline、involved actions/actors、affected resources、相似历史incidents、初步建议。人工完成：root cause结论、action items、sign-off。约70%自动。/ Auto-generate: timeline, involved actions/actors, affected resources, similar historical incidents, initial suggestions. Human completes: root cause conclusion, action items, sign-off. About 70% automated.

349.	postmortem 的结构是什么？固定模板还是自由格式？
What's the postmortem structure? Fixed template or free format?
**答案/Answer**: 提供标准模板（Summary、Timeline、Root Cause、Impact、Action Items）可客户化。Structured sections + free text notes。标准化便于pattern detection。/ Provide standard template (Summary, Timeline, Root Cause, Impact, Action Items) that's customizable. Structured sections + free text notes. Standardization helps pattern detection.

350.	你如何把"重复事故"识别成 pattern？
How do you identify "repeat incidents" as patterns?
**答案/Answer**: 特征匹配：action type + resource type + error signature + time pattern。相似度超阈值标记为potential repeat。人确认后关联到历史incident和learning。/ Feature matching: action type + resource type + error signature + time pattern. Similarity exceeding threshold flagged as potential repeat. Human confirms, then link to historical incident and learning.

351.	pattern 的特征是什么：行动类型、资源、时间、owner、变更？
What are pattern features: action type, resource, time, owner, change?
**答案/Answer**: 主要特征：action type、resource type、error code/message。辅助特征：时间pattern（周几、几点）、recent changes。Owner不是pattern特征——同一问题可能不同人触发。/ Primary features: action type, resource type, error code/message. Secondary features: time patterns (day of week, hour), recent changes. Owner not a pattern feature—same problem can be triggered by different people.

352.	你如何处理"同一事故不同表现"的情况？
How do you handle "same incident, different manifestations"?
**答案/Answer**: Semantic clustering——不只exact match，也做partial match。Root cause相同但symptom不同仍可关联。需要人确认关联合理性。/ Semantic clustering—not just exact match, also partial match. Same root cause but different symptoms can still be associated. Need human confirmation that association is reasonable.

353.	你如何把"组织学习"固化为规则/护栏而不是文字？
How do you turn "organizational learning" into rules/guardrails, not just text?
**答案/Answer**: Postmortem action item → 生成rule draft → 人review并approve → 规则生效。例如：发现pattern后建议"add routing rule for this action type"。Learning → Rule是显式转换。/ Postmortem action item → generate rule draft → human review and approve → rule takes effect. E.g., after discovering pattern, suggest "add routing rule for this action type." Learning → Rule is explicit conversion.

354.	谁批准把学习固化为规则？会不会又回到审批？
Who approves turning learning into rules? Doesn't this become approval again?
**答案/Answer**: 规则变更需要review——这是对系统配置的审批，不是对agent action的审批。区分：config change需要governance ≠ runtime action需要approval。前者合理。/ Rule changes need review—this is approval of system configuration, not agent action approval. Distinguish: config change needs governance ≠ runtime action needs approval. Former is reasonable.

355.	你如何处理"学习固化后阻碍创新/速度"的问题？
How do you handle "learning solidified into rules hindering innovation/speed"?
**答案/Answer**: 规则应该是guardrails不是blockers。规则可以有expiration date、定期review。鼓励"monitored execution"而非"blocked execution"。/ Rules should be guardrails not blockers. Rules can have expiration dates, regular reviews. Encourage "monitored execution" over "blocked execution."

356.	你如何让系统支持"快速试错但不重复犯错"？
How do you let the system support "fast trial-and-error but no repeat mistakes"?
**答案/Answer**: 新错误：record + learn。已知错误再次发生：immediate alert + "we've seen this before" prompt。不阻止尝试新事物，但阻止重复旧错误。/ New errors: record + learn. Known error recurring: immediate alert + "we've seen this before" prompt. Don't block trying new things, but prevent repeating old mistakes.

357.	你如何检测"同样错误发生第二次"？
How do you detect "same error occurring second time"?
**答案/Answer**: Pattern库匹配——新incident与历史patterns对比。Match时标注"Similar to incident #X"并弹出历史学习。关键是pattern定义足够generic但不过宽。/ Pattern library matching—compare new incident with historical patterns. On match, annotate "Similar to incident #X" and surface historical learning. Key is pattern definition generic enough but not too broad.

358.	你如何识别"同样根因不同表象"？
How do you identify "same root cause, different symptoms"?
**答案/Answer**: 需要人工标注建立关联。系统可suggest（基于时间相关、资源overlap）但不自动判定。Root cause analysis本质是人的判断。/ Needs human annotation to establish association. System can suggest (based on time correlation, resource overlap) but doesn't auto-determine. Root cause analysis is fundamentally human judgment.

359.	你如何处理"根因无法确定"的事故？
How do you handle incidents where "root cause can't be determined"?
**答案/Answer**: 允许标记"root cause unknown"。记录所有available facts。未来相似incident发生时可能提供新线索。不强制closure必须有root cause。/ Allow marking "root cause unknown." Record all available facts. Future similar incidents may provide new clues. Don't force closure to require root cause.

360.	你如何记录"未知/不确定性"？
How do you record "unknown/uncertainty"?
**答案/Answer**: Confidence level字段（high/medium/low/unknown）。Notes字段记录不确定原因。Timeline中标注gaps。显式记录不知道什么比假装知道好。/ Confidence level field (high/medium/low/unknown). Notes field records uncertainty reasons. Timeline marks gaps. Explicitly recording what's unknown is better than pretending to know.

361.	你如何避免你的系统输出虚假的确定性？
How do you avoid your system outputting false certainty?
**答案/Answer**: UI措辞使用"possibly"、"may be related"而非断言。显示confidence indicators。不隐藏数据gaps。培训用户理解系统limitations。/ UI wording uses "possibly," "may be related" rather than assertions. Show confidence indicators. Don't hide data gaps. Train users to understand system limitations.

362.	你如何向用户展示置信度？
How do you display confidence to users?
**答案/Answer**: Visual indicators：颜色/图标表示confidence level。Tooltip解释confidence来源。可展开查看underlying evidence。让用户自己评估可信度。/ Visual indicators: colors/icons showing confidence level. Tooltips explain confidence source. Expandable to view underlying evidence. Let users assess credibility themselves.

363.	你如何避免用户对置信度产生错误依赖？
How do you avoid users developing incorrect reliance on confidence?
**答案/Answer**: 文档和onboarding强调：confidence是heuristic不是ground truth。定期review confidence accuracy。鼓励用户结合自己判断。低confidence显著标注。/ Documentation and onboarding emphasize: confidence is heuristic not ground truth. Regularly review confidence accuracy. Encourage users to combine with own judgment. Low confidence prominently marked.

364.	你如何处理"文化上不愿意被记录"的团队？
How do you handle teams "culturally unwilling to be recorded"?
**答案/Answer**: 强调记录是为了帮助不是监控。展示对on-call的好处（减少负担）。提供anonymization选项。最终是组织决策——我们不强制。/ Emphasize recording is for helping, not monitoring. Show benefits for on-call (reduced burden). Provide anonymization options. Ultimately organizational decision—we don't force.

365.	你如何处理"合规上必须记录"的团队？
How do you handle teams where "compliance requires recording"?
**答案/Answer**: 提供完整audit trail、数据保留、导出能力。帮助满足合规要求同时minimizing文化冲突（access controls、need-to-know basis）。/ Provide complete audit trail, data retention, export capability. Help meet compliance requirements while minimizing cultural conflict (access controls, need-to-know basis).
366.	你如何处理"工程师怕被追责而不愿意接入"的情况？
How do you handle "engineers afraid of being blamed so unwilling to connect"?
**答案/Answer**: 强调blameless culture——attribution是"involved"不是"guilty"。展示对on-call的好处。提供anonymization选项。让工程师自己体验价值后自愿扩展。/ Emphasize blameless culture—attribution is "involved" not "guilty." Show on-call benefits. Provide anonymization options. Let engineers experience value themselves before voluntary expansion.

367.	你如何把系统定位为"安全网"而不是"监控器"？
How do you position the system as "safety net" rather than "monitor"?
**答案/Answer**: Messaging强调："帮你更快救火"而非"监视你做了什么"。功能设计：优先routing和recovery建议，attribution是support功能不是主打。/ Messaging emphasizes: "help you fight fires faster" not "watch what you do." Feature design: prioritize routing and recovery suggestions, attribution is support function not main selling point.

368.	你如何处理"incident 期间的信息过载"？
How do you handle "information overload during incidents"?
**答案/Answer**: 优先级排序：只显示high-severity在primary view。折叠低优先级。聚合相似事件。提供"focus mode"只看active incident。减少噪音是核心设计原则。/ Priority sorting: only show high-severity in primary view. Collapse low priority. Aggregate similar events. Provide "focus mode" to only see active incident. Noise reduction is core design principle.

369.	你如何决定"此刻最重要的三件事是什么"？
How do you decide "the three most important things right now"?
**答案/Answer**: 算法：severity × recency × blast radius。自动surfacing top 3。可配置权重。用户可pin/dismiss。重要性判断是heuristic，人可override。/ Algorithm: severity × recency × blast radius. Auto-surface top 3. Configurable weights. Users can pin/dismiss. Importance judgment is heuristic, humans can override.

370.	你系统是否会给出"下一步建议"？如果会，依据是什么？
Does your system give "next step suggestions"? If yes, based on what?
**答案/Answer**: 会——依据：1) 关联的runbook steps 2) 历史相似incident的解决路径 3) Rule-based建议（如"check recent deploys"）。建议不是命令，人决定是否采纳。/ Yes—based on: 1) Associated runbook steps 2) Resolution paths from similar historical incidents 3) Rule-based suggestions (e.g., "check recent deploys"). Suggestions aren't commands, humans decide whether to adopt.

371.	你如何处理"多个建议之间冲突"？
How do you handle "conflicts between multiple suggestions"?
**答案/Answer**: 显示所有建议+标注冲突+"choose one based on your judgment"。不自动决定。提供每个建议的rationale让用户判断。冲突是正常的——复杂问题很少有单一解。/ Display all suggestions + mark conflicts + "choose one based on your judgment." Don't auto-decide. Provide rationale for each suggestion so users can judge. Conflicts are normal—complex problems rarely have single solutions.

372.	你如何记录"决策过程"？
How do you record "decision process"?
**答案/Answer**: 用户在incident中的每个action记录：时间、操作、选择的建议、填写的notes。形成decision audit trail。用于postmortem和learning。/ Record each user action during incident: time, operation, chosen suggestion, notes filled. Form decision audit trail. Used for postmortem and learning.

373.	你如何将"决策过程"用于之后的学习？

**答案/Answer**: 允许手动添加event/note。标注为"manually reported"。不完美总比没有好。通过这些gap识别integration改进点。/ Allow manual event/note addition. Mark as "manually reported." Imperfect is better than nothing. Use these gaps to identify integration improvement points.

375.	你如何处理"系统捕捉了动作但人说没做"？
How do you handle "system captured action but human says they didn't do it"?
**答案/Answer**: 允许dispute标记+调查流程。可能原因：身份被冒用、系统bug、理解差异。审计保留原始记录、dispute记录单独标注。/ Allow dispute marking + investigation process. Possible causes: identity impersonation, system bug, understanding difference. Audit retains original record, dispute recorded separately.

376.	你如何处理"工具链不可靠导致事件丢失"？
How do you handle "unreliable toolchain causing event loss"?
**答案/Answer**: At-least-once delivery保证。客户端retry。服务端dedup。监控ingest gaps。发现丢失时alert客户检查toolchain。我们不能fix客户端问题但能发现它。/ At-least-once delivery guarantee. Client-side retry. Server-side dedup. Monitor ingest gaps. Alert customer to check toolchain when loss detected. We can't fix client-side issues but can detect them.

377.	你如何用 partial data 仍然做出可用路由？
How do you make usable routing with partial data?

**答案/Answer**: 几乎可能：config-only MCP setup（env vars + config file）。但客户需要能access agent的运行环境。真正的zero-code需要agent framework原生支持——那是我们的长期目标。/ Almost possible: config-only MCP setup (env vars + config file). But customer needs access to agent's runtime environment. True zero-code needs native agent framework support—that's our long-term goal.

599.	你如何从"观察"过渡到"路由"？
How do you transition from "observation" to "routing"?
**答案/Answer**: 阶段性：Week 1-2纯观察→Week 3设置第一条rule（high severity→通知）→Week 4+基于observed patterns添加更多rules。数据驱动规则设计。/ Phased: Week 1-2 pure observation → Week 3 set first rule (high severity → notify) → Week 4+ add more rules based on observed patterns. Data-driven rule design.

600.	你如何从"路由"过渡到"干预建议"？
How do you transition from "routing" to "intervention suggestions"?
**答案/Answer**: 当routing稳定后：添加suggested actions模块——"类似incident上次这样处理"。人可忽略或采纳。不是自动执行，是减少查找时间。/ When routing is stable: add suggested actions module—"similar incident was handled this way last time". Humans can ignore or adopt. Not auto-execution, just reducing search time.

601.	你如何从"建议"过渡到"自动化"？
How do you transition from "suggestions" to "automation"?
**答案/Answer**: 只有客户主动要求 + 特定low-risk场景才开放。例如：自动创建postmortem ticket。从不自动修改生产系统。自动化是客户earned feature，不是默认路径。/ Only when customer explicitly requests + specific low-risk scenarios. Example: auto-create postmortem ticket. Never auto-modify production systems. Automation is customer-earned feature, not default path.

602.	你是否需要 professional services？多久会拖累你？
Do you need professional services? How soon will it drag you down?
**答案/Answer**: 尽量避免——PS不scale。如果集成需要PS→产品有问题。目标：95%客户self-serve。5%大客户有paid onboarding但不超过2周。收费覆盖成本。/ Avoid as much as possible—PS doesn't scale. If integration needs PS → product has problems. Goal: 95% customers self-serve. 5% large customers have paid onboarding but ≤2 weeks. Charge to cover costs.

603.	你如何写一份 1 页的试点方案给客户？
How do you write a 1-page pilot proposal for customers?
**答案/Answer**: 结构：Problem（你现在的痛点）→Solution（我们如何解决）→Scope（3 agents、30天）→Success criteria（TTI reduction、visibility score）→Timeline→Pricing（免费或折扣）。/ Structure: Problem (your current pain) → Solution (how we solve it) → Scope (3 agents, 30 days) → Success criteria (TTI reduction, visibility score) → Timeline → Pricing (free or discounted).

604.	你如何定义客户成功：第 1 周、第 4 周、第 12 周分别发生什么？
How do you define customer success: what happens at Week 1, Week 4, Week 12?
**答案/Answer**: Week 1：集成完成、看到第一批events。Week 4：有incidents被route、建立baseline TTI。Week 12：TTI改善可量化、团队习惯使用、扩展到更多agents/teams。/ Week 1: integration complete, see first events. Week 4: incidents being routed, baseline TTI established. Week 12: TTI improvement quantifiable, team habitually using, expanding to more agents/teams.

605.	你的典型 champion 是谁？阻碍者是谁？
Who is your typical champion? Who is the blocker?
**答案/Answer**: Champion：Platform/SRE lead，受agent乱象之苦、需要visibility。Blocker：Security team（"新系统新风险"）、Finance（"又一个工具？"）、Traditionalist（"agents不需要治理"）。/ Champion: Platform/SRE lead, suffering from agent chaos, needs visibility. Blocker: Security team ("new system = new risk"), Finance ("another tool?"), Traditionalist ("agents don't need governance").

606.	你如何在组织里找到 champion？
How do you find the champion in an organization?
**答案/Answer**: 找"agent火灾"的幸存者——经历过agent搞砸但修复了的人。LinkedIn搜AI/ML Platform、Infra Lead。看他们有没有写过agent incident的post。Cold outreach提供价值。/ Find "agent fire" survivors—people who experienced agent mess-ups but fixed them. LinkedIn search AI/ML Platform, Infra Lead. Check if they've posted about agent incidents. Cold outreach offering value.

607.	你如何绕过"安全审查拖三个月"？
How do you bypass "security review takes 3 months"?
**答案/Answer**: 提前准备：SOC2 Type I、penetration test report、已填好的security questionnaire template。Offer sandbox pilot（no prod data）先。Build trust→fast-track prod access。/ Prepare ahead: SOC2 Type I, penetration test report, pre-filled security questionnaire template. Offer sandbox pilot (no prod data) first. Build trust → fast-track prod access.

Ask: weekly feedback, access to their team, honest criticism. Reciprocal relationship.

609.	你愿意把产品 roadmap 让 design partner 影响到什么程度？
How much are you willing to let design partners influence your product roadmap?
**答案/Answer**: 功能优先级可以调——如果多个partner都要同一功能，提前做。核心设计哲学不动——不会因为partner想要approval system而做。Tactics flexible, strategy fixed。/ Feature priority can adjust—if multiple partners want same feature, do it earlier. Core design philosophy doesn't change—won't build approval system just because partner wants it. Tactics flexible, strategy fixed.

610.	你如何防止 design partner 把你带偏？
How do you prevent design partners from leading you astray?
**答案/Answer**: 三角验证：一个partner说的 vs 三个partner都说的。区分"这个公司的问题" vs "这类公司的问题"。Partner需求过滤器：符合vision的做，不符合的记录但不做。/ Triangulation: what one partner says vs what three partners all say. Distinguish "this company's problem" vs "this type of company's problem". Partner request filter: do if fits vision, log but don't do if not.

611.	你如何管理多个 design partner 的冲突需求？
How do you manage conflicting requirements from multiple design partners?
**答案/Answer**: 透明沟通：把冲突摆到台面，解释我们的选择逻辑。找共同底层需求（往往冲突是表层，底层一致）。不能满足的需求→log为future consideration，不承诺时间。/ Transparent communication: put conflicts on the table, explain our decision logic. Find common underlying needs (often conflicts are surface-level, underlying is consistent). Unmet needs → log as future consideration, don't promise timeline.

612.	你如何处理"客户要你做审批系统"的诱惑？
How do you handle the temptation of "customers asking you to build an approval system"?
**答案/Answer**: 拒绝并解释：审批是瓶颈、不scale、最危险的错误事前识别不了。Offer替代：监控+快速介入能力。如果客户坚持→可能不是我们的目标客户。设计哲学是护城河。/ Refuse and explain: approval is bottleneck, doesn't scale, most dangerous errors can't be identified beforehand. Offer alternative: monitoring + fast intervention capability. If customer insists → may not be our target customer. Design philosophy is our moat.

613.	你如何说不？
How do you say no?
**答案/Answer**: "这不符合我们的设计哲学，因为...但我理解你的核心需求是X，我们用Y方式解决。"给理由、给替代方案、不apologetic。坚定但不defensive。/ "This doesn't fit our design philosophy because... but I understand your core need is X, we solve it with Y approach." Give reason, give alternative, don't be apologetic. Firm but not defensive.

614.	你如何证明你解决的是更重要的问题？
How do you prove you're solving the more important problem?
**答案/Answer**: 数据：真实事故回顾——多少是审批能挡住的 vs 多少是需要快速介入的。行业报告引用。客户自己的incident history分析。让数据说话，不是我说服。/ Data: real incident retrospectives—how many could approval have blocked vs how many needed fast intervention. Industry report citations. Customer's own incident history analysis. Let data speak, not me convincing.

615.	你如何做定价谈判？让步空间在哪里？
How do you do pricing negotiation? Where's your room to give?
**答案/Answer**: 可让：付款周期（月付→年付折扣）、试用期长度、第一年折扣。不让：按usage收费的核心模式、免费无限用。底线：确保单位经济可行。价值先行、价格后谈。/ Can give: payment terms (monthly → annual discount), trial length, first-year discount. Won't give: core usage-based model, unlimited free. Bottom line: unit economics must work. Value first, price later.

616.	你如何处理客户要求"年付折扣"与现金流？
How do you handle customer requests for "annual payment discount" vs cash flow?
**答案/Answer**: 年付给15-20%折扣——现金流优先于ARR数字好看。Pre-paid cash > higher MRR on paper。Early stage需要runway。折扣换commitment是好交易。/ Annual payment gets 15-20% discount—cash flow priority over ARR looking good. Pre-paid cash > higher MRR on paper. Early stage needs runway. Discount for commitment is good trade.

617.	你第一年更重要的是收入还是学习？
Is revenue or learning more important in your first year?
**答案/Answer**: Learning优先，但收入是validation。有人付费=有人真的需要。但收费金额不是goal，客户质量和反馈深度才是。10个深度参与的客户 > 50个浅层付费客户。/ Learning priority, but revenue is validation. Someone paying = someone actually needs it. But revenue amount isn't goal, customer quality and feedback depth are. 10 deeply engaged customers > 50 shallow paying customers.

618.	你如何对 YC 解释你会优先做 learning 而不是 revenue？
How do you explain to YC that you'll prioritize learning over revenue?
**答案/Answer**: "Revenue是learning的信号，不是目标。第一年我们要找到repeatable pattern：什么客户、什么pain point、什么价值proposition最work。这些insights决定能否scale。"数据证明learning转化为growth potential。/ "Revenue is signal for learning, not the goal. Year one we need to find repeatable pattern: what customer, what pain point, what value prop works best. These insights determine if we can scale." Show data proving learning converts to growth potential.

619.	你如何写 cold email 给 AI platform lead？
How do you write cold email to an AI platform lead?
**答案/Answer**: 短、specific、value-first。"我注意到你们在用[X agent framework]。很多团队遇到[specific problem]。我们30分钟能让你看到所有agent actions的实时timeline。有兴趣15分钟聊聊吗？"无废话，直击痛点。/ Short, specific, value-first. "I noticed you're using [X agent framework]. Many teams face [specific problem]. We can show you real-time timeline of all agent actions in 30 min. Interested in a 15-min chat?" No fluff, hit the pain point.

620.	你如何写 cold DM 给 SRE lead？
How do you write cold DM to an SRE lead?
**答案/Answer**: 更informal，从他们的post/article切入。"看到你写的[agent incident故事]，很有共鸣。我们在做帮助团队更快定位agent问题的工具。你有10分钟聊聊你的experience吗？"Show I've done homework。/ More informal, cut in from their post/article. "Saw your [agent incident story], really resonated. We're building a tool to help teams locate agent issues faster. Do you have 10 min to chat about your experience?" Show I've done homework.

621.	你如何在 7 天内约到 20 个用户访谈？
How do you book 20 user interviews within 7 days?
**答案/Answer**: Multi-channel同时进行：LinkedIn DM（50+）、cold email（100+）、Twitter/X outreach、Reddit/HN参与相关讨论、warm intros request。10%响应率→需要200+ touches。数量game。/ Multi-channel simultaneously: LinkedIn DM (50+), cold email (100+), Twitter/X outreach, Reddit/HN participate in relevant discussions, warm intro requests. 10% response rate → need 200+ touches. Numbers game.

622.	你如何记录访谈并提炼成产品决策？
How do you record interviews and distill them into product decisions?
**答案/Answer**: 录音+transcript。Tagged notes：pain points、existing solutions、willingness to pay、quotes。Weekly synthesis：什么patterns出现3次以上？哪些假设被验证/推翻？直接影响roadmap优先级。/ Record + transcript. Tagged notes: pain points, existing solutions, willingness to pay, quotes. Weekly synthesis: what patterns appear 3+ times? Which hypotheses validated/invalidated? Directly affects roadmap priority.

623.	你如何证明你不是"只跟朋友聊"？
How do you prove you're not "just talking to friends"?
**答案/Answer**: 来源多样性：cold outreach占比（>50%）、公司类型分布、职位分布。Friends可以intro，但interview对象必须是strangers。Document outreach method for each interview。/ Source diversity: cold outreach percentage (>50%), company type distribution, role distribution. Friends can intro, but interviewees must be strangers. Document outreach method for each interview.

624.	你如何把访谈转成 LOI？
How do you turn interviews into LOI?
**答案/Answer**: 访谈中识别高意向信号：主动问定价、问何时available、说"我们现在就需要这个"。Follow up with LOI template："确认参与pilot意向，预计launch后评估购买"。不强push，顺水推舟。/ Identify high-intent signals during interview: proactively asks pricing, asks when available, says "we need this now". Follow up with LOI template: "Confirming intent to participate in pilot, evaluate purchase after launch." Don't hard push, go with the flow.

625.	你如何把 LOI 转成付费？
How do you turn LOI into payment?
**答案/Answer**: LOI有pilot承诺→deliver exceptional pilot experience→pilot结束前两周开始conversion conversation→show value achieved→present pricing→close。关键：pilot期间over-deliver，让付费决策变得obvious。/ LOI has pilot commitment → deliver exceptional pilot experience → start conversion conversation two weeks before pilot ends → show value achieved → present pricing → close. Key: over-deliver during pilot, make paying decision obvious.

626.	你如何设计 pricing page 让客户自助购买？
How do you design pricing page so customers can self-serve purchase?
**答案/Answer**: 三tier清晰：Free/Starter/Pro。每tier列关键区别（agents数、retention天数、features）。显眼的"Start free"按钮。FAQ覆盖常见问题。无需contact sales即可开始付费tier。/ Three clear tiers: Free/Starter/Pro. Each tier lists key differences (agent count, retention days, features). Prominent "Start free" button. FAQ covers common questions. Can start paid tier without contacting sales.

627.	你如何减少销售摩擦（合同、法务）？
How do you reduce sales friction (contracts, legal)?
**答案/Answer**: Standard terms on website（click-through agreement）。Pre-approved DPA template。对于<$50K deals坚持standard terms。只有enterprise deals才negotiates。Friction = 客户loss，尽量减少。/ Standard terms on website (click-through agreement). Pre-approved DPA template. Insist on standard terms for <$50K deals. Only negotiate for enterprise deals. Friction = customer loss, minimize it.

628.	你如何处理数据处理协议（DPA）？
How do you handle Data Processing Agreements (DPA)?
**答案/Answer**: Pre-drafted GDPR-compliant DPA on website。Standard SCCs included。大多数客户直接签。有custom需求的→legal review但尽量用template。DPA不应该block deals。/ Pre-drafted GDPR-compliant DPA on website. Standard SCCs included. Most customers sign directly. Custom needs → legal review but try to use template. DPA shouldn't block deals.

629.	你如何处理 MSA 里的责任限制（limitation of liability）？
How do you handle limitation of liability in MSA?
**答案/Answer**: Standard cap：12个月费用。不接受unlimited liability。Carve-outs for IP infringement、gross negligence。这是行业标准，不是我们特别苛刻。坚持底线，解释rationale。/ Standard cap: 12 months of fees. Don't accept unlimited liability. Carve-outs for IP infringement, gross negligence. This is industry standard, not us being harsh. Hold the line, explain rationale.

630.	你如何解释"我们是协调层，不负责执行"的责任边界？
How do you explain "we are coordination layer, not responsible for execution" liability boundary?
**答案/Answer**: 清晰类比："我们是路由器不是司机。告诉你路，不替你开车。Agent执行的后果是agent owner的责任。我们帮你看见、帮你介入，但action ownership在你。"写进合同。/ Clear analogy: "We're the router, not the driver. We tell you the route, don't drive for you. Consequences of agent execution are agent owner's responsibility. We help you see, help you intervene, but action ownership is yours." Put in contract.
631.	你如何写 SOW（statement of work）避免 scope creep？
How do you write SOW (statement of work) to avoid scope creep?
**答案/Answer**: Explicit boundaries：in-scope列表、out-of-scope列表。Deliverables具体可验证。Change request流程defined。超出scope=额外费用。模糊是scope creep的温床。/ Explicit boundaries: in-scope list, out-of-scope list. Deliverables specific and verifiable. Change request process defined. Beyond scope = additional cost. Ambiguity breeds scope creep.

632.	你如何衡量 CAC？早期怎么估？
How do you measure CAC? How do you estimate early on?
**答案/Answer**: 早期CAC = (founder time × opportunity cost + direct spend) / customers acquired。现在以founder time为主、spend少。Track hours spent on sales activities。目标：知道可重复的acquisition方式的真实成本。/ Early CAC = (founder time × opportunity cost + direct spend) / customers acquired. Currently mostly founder time, low spend. Track hours on sales activities. Goal: know true cost of repeatable acquisition method.

633.	你如何衡量 LTV？早期怎么估？
How do you measure LTV? How do you estimate early on?
**答案/Answer**: 早期无法精确测LTV——客户不够多、时间不够长。Proxy：pilot-to-paid conversion rate、early expansion signals、qualitative retention indicators。先focus product-market fit，LTV随后可测。/ Can't precisely measure LTV early—not enough customers, not enough time. Proxy: pilot-to-paid conversion rate, early expansion signals, qualitative retention indicators. Focus on product-market fit first, LTV measurable later.

634.	你如何证明 NRR（净收入留存）可行？
How do you prove NRR (net revenue retention) is feasible?
**答案/Answer**: 展示expansion paths：more agents（usage grows）、more teams（seats grow）、more environments（prod+staging）。Pricing设计支持expansion。早期客户的使用增长数据。类似产品的NRR benchmark（Datadog 130%+）。/ Show expansion paths: more agents (usage grows), more teams (seats grow), more environments (prod+staging). Pricing design supports expansion. Early customers' usage growth data. Similar product NRR benchmarks (Datadog 130%+).

635.	你如何让客户扩张：更多 agent、更多团队、更多环境？
How do you get customers to expand: more agents, more teams, more environments?
**答案/Answer**: 自然expansion：一旦一个team有value→other teams想要。Usage-based pricing让添加agents无friction。提供"invite team"功能。Expansion是product-led，不是sales-pushed。做得好→自然扩张。/ Natural expansion: once one team has value → other teams want it. Usage-based pricing makes adding agents frictionless. Provide "invite team" feature. Expansion is product-led, not sales-pushed. Do well → natural expansion.

636.	你如何防止 churn：客户觉得"噪音大/价值不明显"？
How do you prevent churn: customer feels "too much noise / value not obvious"?
**答案/Answer**: Proactive health monitoring：看客户使用pattern。噪音大→帮调规则。价值不明显→发送usage report（"上月你们通过我们处理了X incidents，平均TTI降低Y%"）。Customer success outreach在问题escalate前。/ Proactive health monitoring: watch customer usage patterns. Too much noise → help adjust rules. Value not obvious → send usage report ("Last month you handled X incidents through us, average TTI reduced by Y%"). Customer success outreach before issues escalate.

637.	你如何做 onboarding：第一天就值钱？
How do you do onboarding: valuable on day one?
**答案/Answer**: Day 1 checklist：(1) Connect MCP (2) See first events (3) Set one notification rule (4) Get first Slack alert。每一步有immediate feedback。不等两周才有价值——当天就要"哦，这有用"。/ Day 1 checklist: (1) Connect MCP (2) See first events (3) Set one notification rule (4) Get first Slack alert. Each step has immediate feedback. Don't wait two weeks for value—same day must be "oh, this is useful."

638.	你如何做"事故回放演示"让客户立刻理解？
How do you do "incident replay demo" so customers immediately understand?
**答案/Answer**: 录好的demo环境，有pre-loaded incident data。Walk through："这是incident timeline→这是谁做了什么→这是受影响的owner→这是postmortem"。3分钟内让他们看到完整loop。比讲concept有效100倍。/ Pre-recorded demo environment with pre-loaded incident data. Walk through: "This is incident timeline → this is who did what → these are affected owners → this is postmortem." Within 3 min show them complete loop. 100x more effective than explaining concepts.

639.	你如何讲一个真实故事（case study）？没有用户怎么办？
How do you tell a real story (case study)? What if you have no users?
**答案/Answer**: 没用户时：用自己当case study——"我们自己用我们的产品来监控我们的development agents"。或者：匿名化design partner的story（经许可）。或者：构建hypothetical但realistic scenario基于interview insights。/ No users: use yourself as case study—"We use our own product to monitor our development agents." Or: anonymized design partner story (with permission). Or: build hypothetical but realistic scenario based on interview insights.

640.	你如何用自己的系统制造一个可演示的 incident？
How do you create a demonstrable incident using your own system?
**答案/Answer**: Staging环境里run agents做real tasks（code review、file operations）→trigger故意设计的"问题"（比如agent尝试写入forbidden目录）→demo routing和response流程。真实但受控的incident。/ In staging environment run agents doing real tasks (code review, file operations) → trigger intentionally designed "problem" (e.g., agent tries to write to forbidden directory) → demo routing and response flow. Real but controlled incident.

641.	你如何避免 demo 看起来像玩具？
How do you avoid the demo looking like a toy?
**答案/Answer**: 用真实数据规模（load过去24小时的event volume）。显示production-like complexity（多agents、多services）。Demo流程solve real problem不是show features。UI polish matters——first impression是professional不是MVP。/ Use real data scale (load past 24 hours of event volume). Show production-like complexity (multiple agents, multiple services). Demo flow solves real problem, not just showing features. UI polish matters—first impression is professional, not MVP.

642.	你如何处理客户问："你们和 PagerDuty 有什么不同？"
How do you handle customers asking: "How are you different from PagerDuty?"
**答案/Answer**: "PagerDuty是alerting和on-call scheduling——等问题发生后叫人。我们是在action发生时就开始routing，在incident形成前就有visibility。我们让你更早知道、更快介入，让PagerDuty alert变少。我们是PagerDuty的上游。"/ "PagerDuty is alerting and on-call scheduling—calls people after problems happen. We start routing when actions happen, have visibility before incidents form. We let you know earlier, intervene faster, make PagerDuty alerts fewer. We're upstream of PagerDuty."

643.	你如何处理客户问："你们和 Datadog 有什么不同？"
How do you handle customers asking: "How are you different from Datadog?"
**答案/Answer**: "Datadog tells you what happened. We help you know who should act and how fast they can intervene. Datadog是observability，我们是operational coordination。我们consume Datadog的data，不replace它。不同层的问题。"/ "Datadog tells you what happened. We help you know who should act and how fast they can intervene. Datadog is observability, we're operational coordination. We consume Datadog's data, don't replace it. Different layers."

644.	你如何处理客户问："你们为什么不直接做 rollback？"
How do you handle customers asking: "Why don't you just do rollback?"
**答案/Answer**: "Rollback不是技术能力，是社会能力——谁知道怎么修、谁愿意修。大多数事故不是没人能修，是不知道找谁。我们解决找谁的问题。Rollback只是recovery路径之一，不是核心。"引用设计哲学。/ "Rollback isn't a technical capability, it's a social capability—who knows how to fix, who's willing to fix. Most incidents aren't about no one able to fix, it's not knowing who to find. We solve the who-to-find problem. Rollback is just one recovery path, not the core." Cite design philosophy.

645.	你如何处理客户问："你们为什么不直接做 approvals？"
How do you handle customers asking: "Why don't you just do approvals?"
**答案/Answer**: "Approvals让authorization成为瓶颈——agent速度快，人审批不过来。而且最危险的错误事前识别不了。我们的哲学是：让执行发生，但让人类能及时介入。比阻止更重要的是能立刻知道发生了什么。"/ "Approvals make authorization a bottleneck—agents are fast, humans can't approve fast enough. And the most dangerous errors can't be identified beforehand. Our philosophy: let execution happen, but let humans intervene in time. More important than blocking is immediately knowing what happened."

646.	你如何处理客户问："这不是 Slack workflow 吗？"
How do you handle customers asking: "Isn't this just a Slack workflow?"
**答案/Answer**: "Slack workflow需要你手动设置每个routing rule。我们有ownership graph——知道谁own什么、automatically route到right person。而且我们有learning loop——postmortem后自动发现pattern并建议rule updates。不是manual workflow，是intelligent coordination。"/ "Slack workflow requires you to manually set up each routing rule. We have ownership graph—know who owns what, automatically route to right person. Plus we have learning loop—postmortem discovers patterns and suggests rule updates. Not manual workflow, intelligent coordination."

647.	你如何处理客户问："我们有 runbooks，不需要你"？
How do you handle customers asking: "We have runbooks, we don't need you"?
**答案/Answer**: "Runbooks解决how-to-fix。我们解决who-should-fix和when-did-it-break。Runbook在那儿，但事故发生时：谁知道用哪个runbook？谁知道找谁执行？我们帮routing到right person with right context，包括link到relevant runbook。"/ "Runbooks solve how-to-fix. We solve who-should-fix and when-did-it-break. Runbook is there, but when incident happens: who knows which runbook to use? Who knows who to find to execute? We help route to right person with right context, including link to relevant runbook."

M. 反事实、压力测试、极端场景（100）
648.	如果 agent 执行速度再快 10 倍，你系统还能跟上吗？
If agent execution speed increases 10x, can your system keep up?
**答案/Answer**: 是的。我们不在执行路径上阻塞——async capture、streaming ingest。Bottleneck是storage和query，可水平扩展。Agent快了人反而更需要我们——没有我们更看不见。/ Yes. We're not blocking on execution path—async capture, streaming ingest. Bottleneck is storage and query, horizontally scalable. Faster agents means humans need us more—without us, even less visibility.

649.	如果团队人数翻倍，你系统价值是线性增长还是指数增长？
If team size doubles, does your system's value grow linearly or exponentially?
**答案/Answer**: 超线性但不是指数——coordination complexity grows faster than team size (O(n²) communication paths)。Owner graph价值随team size增长、routing更重要。但不是无限——到某个规模会plateau。/ Superlinear but not exponential—coordination complexity grows faster than team size (O(n²) communication paths). Owner graph value grows with team size, routing becomes more important. But not infinite—plateaus at certain scale.

650.	如果团队文化完全不写文档，你系统会更值钱还是更难卖？
If team culture doesn't write documentation at all, does your system become more valuable or harder to sell?
**答案/Answer**: 更值钱——没有文档意味着knowledge在人脑里、更需要routing到right person。我们让tacit knowledge变成显式的ownership mapping。但更难卖因为这类团队可能也不care about tooling。/ More valuable—no docs means knowledge is in people's heads, more need to route to right person. We turn tacit knowledge into explicit ownership mapping. But harder to sell because such teams may not care about tooling.

651.	如果团队文化非常流程化（ITIL），你系统会更值钱还是更难嵌入？
If team culture is very process-oriented (ITIL), does your system become more valuable or harder to embed?
**答案/Answer**: 更难嵌入——ITIL teams有existing workflows、change management、approval chains。但一旦嵌入可能更sticky。需要position为"augment existing process"而非"replace"。找ITIL流程里的gaps。/ Harder to embed—ITIL teams have existing workflows, change management, approval chains. But once embedded, potentially more sticky. Need to position as "augment existing process" not "replace". Find gaps in ITIL flows.

652.	如果客户禁止任何"自动路由"，只允许"观测"，你还能卖吗？
If customer prohibits any "auto routing", only allows "observation", can you still sell?
**答案/Answer**: 可以——observation-only mode依然有价值：timeline view、attribution、who-did-what。但价值打折、定价相应低。用observation build trust→eventually allow routing。是landing strategy。/ Yes—observation-only mode still has value: timeline view, attribution, who-did-what. But value discounted, price accordingly lower. Use observation to build trust → eventually allow routing. It's a landing strategy.

653.	如果客户要求"强审批"，你如何拒绝并仍然成交？
If customer demands "strong approval", how do you refuse and still close the deal?
**答案/Answer**: Offer替代方案："我们不做pre-execution approval，但我们做real-time notification + one-click pause。你能在seconds内介入，比approval快且不block agent速度。"如果他们坚持需要approval→可能不是我们的客户。/ Offer alternative: "We don't do pre-execution approval, but we do real-time notification + one-click pause. You can intervene in seconds, faster than approval without blocking agent speed." If they insist on approval → may not be our customer.

654.	如果客户说"我们事故不多"，你怎么卖？
If customer says "we don't have many incidents", how do you sell?
**答案/Answer**: "事故不多可能是因为还没scale agents。或者——事故发生了但没人发现。我们的visibility能让你确认是真的没事还是invisible incidents。而且：prevention比recovery便宜。"质疑假设。/ "Not many incidents may be because you haven't scaled agents yet. Or—incidents happen but no one notices. Our visibility lets you confirm if it's really fine or invisible incidents. Plus: prevention is cheaper than recovery." Challenge assumptions.

655.	如果客户说"我们事故很多但我们不想记录"，你怎么卖？
If customer says "we have many incidents but don't want to record them", how do you sell?
**答案/Answer**: 红旗——这种文化不是我们的目标客户。如果他们怕blame，我们可以explain blameless postmortem理念。但如果坚持不记录→我们无法提供价值。不是所有客户都值得追。/ Red flag—this culture isn't our target customer. If they fear blame, we can explain blameless postmortem philosophy. But if insist on not recording → we can't provide value. Not all customers worth pursuing.

656.	如果客户说"我们事故很多但我们已经有 SRE"，你怎么卖？
If customer says "we have many incidents but we already have SRE", how do you sell?
**答案/Answer**: "SRE处理incidents，但agents创造new category的incidents。Your SRE team需要visibility into agent actions。我们帮SRE更快定位agent-caused issues。We're a tool for SRE, not replacement。"/ "SRE handles incidents, but agents create new category of incidents. Your SRE team needs visibility into agent actions. We help SRE locate agent-caused issues faster. We're a tool for SRE, not replacement."

657.	如果客户说"我们完全不相信 AI"，你怎么卖？
If customer says "we don't trust AI at all", how do you sell?
**答案/Answer**: "那你更需要我们——如果你不信任AI但还是要用（因为competitive pressure），你需要visibility和control。我们让你看见AI在干什么，而不是blind trust。"不信任AI + 不得不用AI = 需要我们。/ "Then you need us more—if you don't trust AI but still have to use it (competitive pressure), you need visibility and control. We let you see what AI is doing instead of blind trust." Don't trust AI + must use AI = need us.

658.	如果客户说"我们完全依赖 AI"，你怎么防止他们过度自动化？
If customer says "we completely rely on AI", how do you prevent them from over-automating?
**答案/Answer**: 不是我们的责任prevent——但我们provide data让他们做informed决策。Show them TTI metrics、intervention patterns。"你们很多incidents人没介入——是因为不需要还是来不及？"让数据说话。/ Not our responsibility to prevent—but we provide data for them to make informed decisions. Show them TTI metrics, intervention patterns. "Many of your incidents had no human intervention—because unnecessary or too late?" Let data speak.

659.	如果客户说"我们的 agent 全是供应商的黑盒"，你怎么归因？
If customer says "all our agents are vendor black boxes", how do you do attribution?
**答案/Answer**: MCP是我们的切入点——即使agent内部是黑盒，tool calls通过MCP可见。归因到：哪个vendor agent、什么时间、调用什么tool。黑盒变灰盒。内部逻辑不知道，但action知道。/ MCP is our entry point—even if agent internals are black box, tool calls are visible through MCP. Attribute to: which vendor agent, what time, what tool called. Black box becomes gray box. Don't know internal logic, but know actions.

660.	如果客户的 agent 无法输出 tool-call logs，你怎么做？
If customer's agent can't output tool-call logs, how do you proceed?
**答案/Answer**: Fallback data sources：API gateway logs、database audit logs、git commit history。Less granular但still useful。推动客户upgrade agent或加instrumentation。"Without tool-call visibility, we can only attribute to agent level, not action level。"/ Fallback data sources: API gateway logs, database audit logs, git commit history. Less granular but still useful. Push customer to upgrade agent or add instrumentation. "Without tool-call visibility, we can only attribute to agent level, not action level."

661.	如果客户只有 metrics 没有 logs，你怎么做？
If customer only has metrics, no logs, how do you proceed?
**答案/Answer**: Metrics做anomaly detection trigger、logs做root cause。没logs→能detect问题但不能精确归因。Offer limited mode："Alert when metric anomaly correlates with agent activity timeframe。"鼓励加logging。/ Metrics for anomaly detection trigger, logs for root cause. No logs → can detect issues but can't precisely attribute. Offer limited mode: "Alert when metric anomaly correlates with agent activity timeframe." Encourage adding logging.

662.	如果客户只有 logs 没有 trace，你怎么做？
If customer only has logs, no traces, how do you proceed?
**答案/Answer**: Logs够用——我们主要需要知道who-did-what-when。Traces是enrichment not requirement。用log timestamps和correlation IDs做关联。没trace的话跨service归因harder，但单service内足够。/ Logs are sufficient—we mainly need who-did-what-when. Traces are enrichment not requirement. Use log timestamps and correlation IDs for correlation. Without traces, cross-service attribution harder, but sufficient within single service.

663.	如果客户只有 chat 记录，你怎么做？
If customer only has chat records, how do you proceed?
**答案/Answer**: Chat-only = 只有human-to-agent conversations。能知道谁request什么，但不知道agent实际做了什么。Very limited。"We need action logs, not just conversation logs。"可以从chat extract intent但无法verify execution。/ Chat-only = only human-to-agent conversations. Can know who requested what, but not what agent actually did. Very limited. "We need action logs, not just conversation logs." Can extract intent from chat but can't verify execution.

664.	如果客户只有 git 变更记录，你怎么做？
If customer only has git change records, how do you proceed?
**答案/Answer**: Git-centric mode：每个commit归因到author（human or agent）。"Code change-focused coordination。"Limited to code changes only——database changes、API calls看不到。但对code-heavy workflows有价值。/ Git-centric mode: attribute each commit to author (human or agent). "Code change-focused coordination." Limited to code changes only—database changes, API calls not visible. But valuable for code-heavy workflows.

665.	如果事故发生在第三方（Stripe outage），你系统能做什么？
If incident is at third party (Stripe outage), what can your system do?
**答案/Answer**: 快速定位哪些内部services受影响、route到affected service owners。"Stripe down→哪些agents调用Stripe→哪些workflows broken→notify those owners。"不能修Stripe，但能coordinate internal response。/ Quickly locate which internal services affected, route to affected service owners. "Stripe down → which agents call Stripe → which workflows broken → notify those owners." Can't fix Stripe, but can coordinate internal response.

666.	如果事故是慢性性能退化，你系统能做什么？
If incident is chronic performance degradation, what can your system do?
**答案/Answer**: 需要和metrics系统配合。如果degradation correlates with某agent activity pattern→show correlation。"过去30天，每当这个agent batch run后，latency上升。"不做detection，但做attribution once detected。/ Need to work with metrics system. If degradation correlates with certain agent activity pattern → show correlation. "Past 30 days, every time this agent batch runs, latency increases." Don't do detection, but do attribution once detected.

667.	如果事故是数据被静默污染，你系统能做什么？
If incident is silent data corruption, what can your system do?
**答案/Answer**: 如果corruption被发现→我们能追溯：谁在什么时候写了这些数据。"在这个时间窗口内，这些agents写了这个table。"Silent corruption发现晚是系统固有挑战，我们不做detection但做forensics。/ If corruption is discovered → we can trace back: who wrote this data when. "In this time window, these agents wrote to this table." Silent corruption discovered late is inherent system challenge, we don't do detection but do forensics.

668.	如果事故是权限被误改导致泄露，你系统能做什么？
If incident is permission misconfiguration causing leak, what can your system do?
**答案/Answer**: Permission change是一种action——我们能track谁改了什么permission。如果permission changes go through我们monitored的tools→有audit trail。Route to security team。"这个agent在这个时间改了这个IAM policy。"/ Permission change is an action—we can track who changed what permission. If permission changes go through tools we monitor → have audit trail. Route to security team. "This agent changed this IAM policy at this time."

669.	如果事故是成本爆炸，你系统能做什么？
If incident is cost explosion, what can your system do?
**答案/Answer**: 不做成本监控（那是FinOps tools的事），但如果cost alert触发→我们能help定位：哪些agents在这个时间段做了什么。"Cost spike correlates with这个agent的activity burst。"Correlation不是causation但是starting point。/ Don't do cost monitoring (that's FinOps tools' job), but if cost alert triggers → we can help locate: what agents did during this period. "Cost spike correlates with this agent's activity burst." Correlation isn't causation but is starting point.

670.	如果事故是 agent 自己写了一个循环脚本把系统打爆，你系统能做什么？
If incident is agent writing a loop script that crashes the system, what can your system do?
**答案/Answer**: 如果script creation是通过monitored tool→我们有record。"这个agent写了这个script、这个时间执行。"不能prevent（不做approval），但能fast attribute。如果script execution也被monitor→能看到loop pattern。/ If script creation was through monitored tool → we have record. "This agent wrote this script, executed at this time." Can't prevent (we don't do approval), but can fast attribute. If script execution is also monitored → can see loop pattern.
671.	如果事故是人类手动操作导致，你系统能抓到吗？
If incident is caused by human manual operations, can your system catch it?
**答案/Answer**: 如果human action通过我们monitor的tools（CLI、console等）→是的。如果human直接SSH到server做事→depends on是否有audit log feed。Human和agent对我们来说是同一种actor type。/ If human action through tools we monitor (CLI, console, etc.) → yes. If human directly SSH to server → depends on whether there's audit log feed. Human and agent are same actor type to us.

672.	如果事故是并发写入导致竞态，你系统能定位吗？
If incident is race condition from concurrent writes, can your system locate it?
**答案/Answer**: 能看到时间线上overlapping writes，但不能conclusively证明race condition。"这两个agents在同一秒写了同一个resource"——suspicious but需要人判断是否真的是race。提供evidence不做diagnosis。/ Can see overlapping writes on timeline, but can't conclusively prove race condition. "These two agents wrote to same resource in same second"—suspicious but humans need to judge if it's really a race. Provide evidence, don't do diagnosis.

673.	如果事故是"谁都不愿意认领"，你系统怎么处理？
If incident is "no one willing to claim ownership", how does your system handle it?
**答案/Answer**: Ownership graph指向谁就route给谁——不管他们愿不愿意。Escalation path到management。但我们不能强迫人respond——组织问题需要组织解决。我们只能让"谁应该负责"变得visible。/ Ownership graph points to someone → route to them—regardless if they're willing. Escalation path to management. But we can't force people to respond—organizational problems need organizational solutions. We can only make "who should be responsible" visible.

674.	如果事故是"两个团队互相甩锅"，你系统会火上浇油吗？
If incident is "two teams blaming each other", will your system add fuel to fire?
**答案/Answer**: 风险存在——我们的attribution可能被用来blame。Mitigation：blameless postmortem模式隐藏individual names、focus on actions not people。培训客户正确使用。我们是镜子，不决定如何interpret reflection。/ Risk exists—our attribution may be used for blame. Mitigation: blameless postmortem mode hides individual names, focus on actions not people. Train customers on proper use. We're a mirror, don't decide how to interpret the reflection.

675.	如果事故是"政治敏感"，你系统如何避免被封杀？
If incident is "politically sensitive", how does your system avoid being shut down?
**答案/Answer**: 我们是工具不是judge。Data is data。如果客户因为political reasons不想记录→他们的选择。我们不做任何自动reporting to外部。Access control让客户控制谁能看什么。中立工具立场。/ We're a tool, not a judge. Data is data. If customer doesn't want to record for political reasons → their choice. We don't do any auto-reporting to external parties. Access control lets customers control who sees what. Neutral tool stance.

676.	如果事故是"合规敏感"，你系统如何提供证据？
If incident is "compliance-sensitive", how does your system provide evidence?
**答案/Answer**: Audit logs不可篡改、有timestamps、有chain of custody。Export功能生成forensic-ready reports。可以作为compliance evidence。配合客户的legal/compliance team需求。我们是记录者不是裁判。/ Audit logs immutable, have timestamps, have chain of custody. Export function generates forensic-ready reports. Can serve as compliance evidence. Cooperate with customer's legal/compliance team needs. We're recorder, not judge.

677.	如果客户要求你提供"谁犯错最多"的报表，你给吗？
If customer asks you to provide "who makes most mistakes" report, will you give it?
**答案/Answer**: 不主动提供——这是blame tool不是我们的定位。数据technically可以derived，但我们不build this feature。引导客户focus on patterns and processes，不是individuals。文化引导。/ Don't proactively provide—this is blame tool, not our positioning. Data can technically be derived, but we don't build this feature. Guide customers to focus on patterns and processes, not individuals. Cultural guidance.

678.	如果不给，你怎么解释？
If you don't give it, how do you explain?
**答案/Answer**: "Our design philosophy is blameless incident response. Individual error counts don't improve systems—understanding patterns does. We provide 'which actions cause incidents most often', not 'who causes incidents most often'。"Focus on what，not who。/ "Our design philosophy is blameless incident response. Individual error counts don't improve systems—understanding patterns does. We provide 'which actions cause incidents most often', not 'who causes incidents most often'." Focus on what, not who.

679.	如果给，你怎么避免成为监控工具？
If you give it, how do you avoid becoming a surveillance tool?
**答案/Answer**: 如果迫不得已提供（比如legal requirement）：限制access只给HR/Legal、audit log谁accessed、明确warning about misuse、require sign-off on acceptable use policy。Make friction high。/ If forced to provide (e.g., legal requirement): restrict access to HR/Legal only, audit log who accessed, explicit warning about misuse, require sign-off on acceptable use policy. Make friction high.

680.	如果客户要求"把某人踢出 on-call"，你怎么处理？
If customer asks to "remove someone from on-call", how do you handle it?
**答案/Answer**: 那是他们的组织决策不是我们的系统功能。我们reflect他们的on-call配置（从PagerDuty等同步），不make personnel decisions。"你在PagerDuty改，我们自动同步。"边界清晰。/ That's their organizational decision, not our system function. We reflect their on-call configuration (sync from PagerDuty etc.), don't make personnel decisions. "You change it in PagerDuty, we auto-sync." Clear boundaries.

681.	你的系统是否可能造成法律风险？哪种？
Is it possible your system creates legal risk? What kind?
**答案/Answer**: 可能：(1) 数据作为evidence in litigation (2) 隐私侵犯（如果monitor个人without consent）(3) Wrongful termination if used for blame。Mitigation：clear data policies、usage guidelines、customer education。/ Possible: (1) Data as evidence in litigation (2) Privacy violation (if monitoring individuals without consent) (3) Wrongful termination if used for blame. Mitigation: clear data policies, usage guidelines, customer education.

682.	如果你被要求出庭提供日志，你怎么处理？
If you're required to appear in court and provide logs, how do you handle it?
**答案/Answer**: 遵守legal process——subpoena就配合。提前告知affected customer（除非legally prohibited）。只提供specifically requested data。有legal counsel review response。这是SaaS标准practice。/ Comply with legal process—cooperate with subpoena. Inform affected customer in advance (unless legally prohibited). Only provide specifically requested data. Have legal counsel review response. This is standard SaaS practice.

683.	如果客户要求"删除某段历史"，你怎么处理？
If customer asks to "delete certain history", how do you handle it?
**答案/Answer**: Distinguish：(1) Legitimate GDPR/CCPA request→comply (2) Cover-up attempt→拒绝。如果是合规删除，我们配合。如果是因为内容不利想删→explain audit log integrity重要性。Legal requirement优先。/ Distinguish: (1) Legitimate GDPR/CCPA request → comply (2) Cover-up attempt → refuse. If compliance deletion, we cooperate. If wanting to delete because content is unfavorable → explain audit log integrity importance. Legal requirement takes priority.

684.	如果客户要求"永不删除"，你怎么处理成本？
If customer asks "never delete", how do you handle cost?
**答案/Answer**: 可以——但收费。Long-term retention = storage成本。Tiered pricing：hot storage (recent) → warm → cold archive。如果永久保留→价格reflect storage cost。Customer pays for what they need。/ Can do—but charge for it. Long-term retention = storage cost. Tiered pricing: hot storage (recent) → warm → cold archive. If permanent retention → price reflects storage cost. Customer pays for what they need.

685.	如果客户要求"所有数据加密且你不能解密"，你怎么提供功能？
If customer asks "all data encrypted and you can't decrypt", how do you provide functionality?
**答案/Answer**: Customer-managed keys (BYOK)可以——但限制：我们不能index encrypted content、search功能受限。Trade-off：security vs functionality。Offer but clearly explain limitations。/ Customer-managed keys (BYOK) possible—but limitations: we can't index encrypted content, search functionality limited. Trade-off: security vs functionality. Offer but clearly explain limitations.

686.	如果客户要求"airgap"，你怎么部署与更新？
If customer asks for "airgap", how do you deploy and update?
**答案/Answer**: On-premise deployment option。更新via offline package delivery。会更慢、需要customer ops参与。Premium pricing因为support成本高。Enterprise-only feature。不是我们的primary path，但technically doable。/ On-premise deployment option. Updates via offline package delivery. Will be slower, requires customer ops participation. Premium pricing because support cost is high. Enterprise-only feature. Not our primary path, but technically doable.

687.	如果客户要求"只读权限"，你如何集成？
If customer asks for "read-only permissions", how do you integrate?
**答案/Answer**: 我们default就是read-only——从MCP capture events、不write to customer systems。"Only读你们的data，不modify anything。"这是我们的natural mode。No special config needed。/ We're read-only by default—capture events from MCP, don't write to customer systems. "Only read your data, don't modify anything." This is our natural mode. No special config needed.

688.	如果客户要求"写入权限"，你是否接受？
If customer asks for "write permissions", do you accept?
**答案/Answer**: 非常limited scope：写postmortem to ticketing system、send notifications。不write to production systems。如果客户要我们执行actions→out of scope。"We coordinate, we don't execute。"设计哲学限制。/ Very limited scope: write postmortem to ticketing system, send notifications. Don't write to production systems. If customer wants us to execute actions → out of scope. "We coordinate, we don't execute." Design philosophy limitation.

689.	如果客户要求你执行自动修复，你是否接受？
If customer asks you to execute auto-remediation, do you accept?
**答案/Answer**: 不——违反设计哲学。我们route到人、提供建议，不自动执行修复。"Auto-remediation需要另一种产品，不是我们。"但可以integrate with tools that do remediation。边界明确。/ No—violates design philosophy. We route to humans, provide suggestions, don't auto-execute fixes. "Auto-remediation needs a different product, not us." But can integrate with tools that do remediation. Clear boundaries.

690.	如果客户要求你保证 MTTR 降低 50%，你敢签 SLA 吗？
If customer asks you to guarantee 50% MTTR reduction, do you dare sign SLA?
**答案/Answer**: 不签outcome SLA——MTTR depends on太多我们不控制的因素（人的响应速度、问题复杂度等）。签service SLA（uptime、latency）可以。Outcome是joint effort，不是单方保证。/ Don't sign outcome SLA—MTTR depends on too many factors we don't control (human response speed, problem complexity, etc.). Can sign service SLA (uptime, latency). Outcome is joint effort, not unilateral guarantee.

691.	你敢签什么 SLA？
What SLA do you dare sign?
**答案/Answer**: Service SLAs：99.9% uptime、event ingestion latency <1s p99、notification delivery <5s。这些我们能控制。Business outcome SLAs（MTTR、incidents数量）→不签。/ Service SLAs: 99.9% uptime, event ingestion latency <1s p99, notification delivery <5s. These we can control. Business outcome SLAs (MTTR, incident count) → don't sign.

692.	如果你签 SLA，违反怎么办？
If you sign SLA and violate it, what happens?
**答案/Answer**: Standard remedy：service credits（prorated refund）。不是cash penalty——那会kill startup。"Miss SLA for the month → X% credit on next invoice。"Industry standard practice。/ Standard remedy: service credits (prorated refund). Not cash penalty—that would kill startup. "Miss SLA for the month → X% credit on next invoice." Industry standard practice.

693.	如果你不签 SLA，客户为什么信你？
If you don't sign SLA, why do customers trust you?
**答案/Answer**: 签service SLA（uptime等），只是不签outcome SLA。Plus：pilot期间prove value、customer references、transparent metrics dashboard showing our performance。Trust earned through results not promises。/ Sign service SLA (uptime etc.), just don't sign outcome SLA. Plus: prove value during pilot, customer references, transparent metrics dashboard showing our performance. Trust earned through results not promises.

694.	如果你做成了，你最可能被哪类公司收购？
If you succeed, what type of company is most likely to acquire you?
**答案/Answer**: 几类可能：(1) Observability company (Datadog, Splunk)扩展到coordination (2) DevOps platform (GitLab, Atlassian)扩展到AI ops (3) Cloud provider wanting agent governance。也可能不卖——看market size能否支撑独立company。/ Several possibilities: (1) Observability company (Datadog, Splunk) expanding to coordination (2) DevOps platform (GitLab, Atlassian) expanding to AI ops (3) Cloud provider wanting agent governance. May also not sell—depends if market size supports independent company.

695.	如果你不想被收购，你如何独立做大？
If you don't want to be acquired, how do you grow independently?
**答案/Answer**: (1) Expand TAM：不只agent governance，是organizational coordination for AI age (2) Platform play：others build on top of our owner graph (3) International expansion (4) Adjacent products（training、compliance、reporting）。核心：market大到能支撑IPO path。/ (1) Expand TAM: not just agent governance, organizational coordination for AI age (2) Platform play: others build on top of our owner graph (3) International expansion (4) Adjacent products (training, compliance, reporting). Core: market large enough to support IPO path.

696.	如果市场最终变成"agent runtime 内置一切"，你如何生存？
If market ends up with "agent runtime has everything built-in", how do you survive?
**答案/Answer**: Multi-agent coordination是cross-runtime problem。单个runtime内置自己的monitoring不解决跨vendor、跨framework的问题。我们是integration layer。如果只有一个runtime赢了→risk exists。Bet on heterogeneous agent ecosystem。/ Multi-agent coordination is cross-runtime problem. Single runtime's built-in monitoring doesn't solve cross-vendor, cross-framework problems. We're integration layer. If only one runtime wins → risk exists. Bet on heterogeneous agent ecosystem.

697.	如果市场最终变成"企业强监管强审批"，你的路线会被淘汰吗？
If market ends up with "strong enterprise regulation and strong approvals", will your approach be obsoleted?
**答案/Answer**: 如果regulation要求pre-approval→我们pivot加approval module。但我argue这不会发生——approval不scale，市场会realize this。我们是betting on "fast intervention > slow approval"会win。Conviction-based bet。/ If regulation requires pre-approval → we pivot to add approval module. But I argue this won't happen—approval doesn't scale, market will realize this. We're betting on "fast intervention > slow approval" will win. Conviction-based bet.

698.	如果市场最终变成"完全自动化无人值守"，你的产品还需要人吗？
If market ends up with "fully automated, unmanned", does your product still need humans?
**答案/Answer**: 即使完全自动化，someone needs to be accountable。Ownership still matters for liability、auditing、improvement。我们会evolve：human intervention减少，但attribution and learning loop依然需要。"Who's responsible when things go wrong" never goes away。/ Even with full automation, someone needs to be accountable. Ownership still matters for liability, auditing, improvement. We'll evolve: human intervention decreases, but attribution and learning loop still needed. "Who's responsible when things go wrong" never goes away.

699.	如果未来 agent 自己能做 postmortem，人还需要你的协调层吗？
If agents can do postmortem themselves in the future, do humans still need your coordination layer?
**答案/Answer**: Agent做postmortem需要data——谁提供？我们。而且postmortem output需要route给humans做决策。Agent-generated postmortem是feature我们可以add。Coordination layer变成human-agent coordination不只是human-human。/ Agents doing postmortem need data—who provides it? Us. And postmortem output needs to route to humans for decisions. Agent-generated postmortem is a feature we can add. Coordination layer becomes human-agent coordination, not just human-human.

700.	如果未来 agent 自己能找 owner，人还需要你吗？
If agents can find owners themselves in the future, do humans still need you?
**答案/Answer**: Agent找owner也需要owner graph——谁维护？我们。而且audit trail依然重要。Agent自主routing是我们可以enable的capability。我们evolve from human-coordination to agent-enabled-coordination。Platform层面的价值不会消失。/ Agents finding owners also need owner graph—who maintains it? Us. And audit trail still important. Agent self-routing is capability we can enable. We evolve from human-coordination to agent-enabled-coordination. Platform-level value doesn't disappear.
701.	你如何把系统演化到"人减少但仍然需要协调"的形态？
How do you evolve the system to "fewer humans but still need coordination"?
**答案/Answer**: Owner graph evolves：human→team→automated runbook→agent。Routing target变化但routing logic不变。Learning loop feeds back to rule automation。Human从every-incident到exception-only。Coordination layer remains，operators减少。/ Owner graph evolves: human → team → automated runbook → agent. Routing target changes but routing logic doesn't. Learning loop feeds back to rule automation. Human goes from every-incident to exception-only. Coordination layer remains, operators decrease.

702.	你如何把系统演化到"人只在关键点介入"的形态？
How do you evolve the system to "humans only intervene at critical points"?
**答案/Answer**: 通过data定义"关键点"：哪些incident types需要human judgment、哪些可以auto-resolve。Learning loop识别patterns。人介入点收窄but不消失。Residual human judgment是permanent feature。/ Define "critical points" through data: which incident types need human judgment, which can auto-resolve. Learning loop identifies patterns. Human intervention points narrow but don't disappear. Residual human judgment is permanent feature.

703.	你如何定义那个关键点？
How do you define that critical point?
**答案/Answer**: Critical point = (1) Irreversible actions (2) High blast radius (3) Novel/unknown patterns (4) Cross-team coordination required (5) Regulatory requirements。这些由policy定义not AI判断。客户配置他们的boundaries。/ Critical point = (1) Irreversible actions (2) High blast radius (3) Novel/unknown patterns (4) Cross-team coordination required (5) Regulatory requirements. These defined by policy not AI judgment. Customers configure their boundaries.

704.	你如何保证关键点不会无限扩大？
How do you ensure critical points don't expand infinitely?
**答案/Answer**: Default narrow、opt-in expand。Monitor "critical routing" volume——if expanding→flag for review。客户可以see trending data："过去30天你们的critical事件占比从5%升到15%，要review规则吗？"数据驱动decision。/ Default narrow, opt-in expand. Monitor "critical routing" volume—if expanding → flag for review. Customers can see trending data: "Past 30 days your critical events went from 5% to 15%, want to review rules?" Data-driven decision.

705.	你如何避免 scope creep 让你变成"万能平台"？
How do you avoid scope creep turning you into "platform for everything"?
**答案/Answer**: Clear boundaries：我们是coordination layer，不是execution layer、不是analytics platform、不是ticketing system。Say no to features outside scope。Design philosophy document是north star。Every feature request问："这是coordination还是其他？"/ Clear boundaries: we're coordination layer, not execution layer, not analytics platform, not ticketing system. Say no to features outside scope. Design philosophy document is north star. Every feature request asks: "Is this coordination or something else?"

706.	你如何避免做成"第二个 Jira"？
How do you avoid becoming "second Jira"?
**答案/Answer**: Jira是project management——long-lived tasks、sprints、backlogs。我们是real-time coordination——immediate incidents、routing、intervention。完全不同的time scale。如果有人要ticket management→"use Jira, we integrate with it。"/ Jira is project management—long-lived tasks, sprints, backlogs. We're real-time coordination—immediate incidents, routing, intervention. Completely different time scale. If someone wants ticket management → "use Jira, we integrate with it."

707.	你如何避免做成"第二个 ServiceNow"？
How do you avoid becoming "second ServiceNow"?
**答案/Answer**: ServiceNow是ITSM——workflows、change management、CMDB owned by IT。我们是developer-centric、real-time、agent-focused。我们不做ticketing workflows或approval chains。不同user persona、不同use case。/ ServiceNow is ITSM—workflows, change management, CMDB owned by IT. We're developer-centric, real-time, agent-focused. We don't do ticketing workflows or approval chains. Different user persona, different use case.

708.	你如何避免做成"第二个 Datadog"？
How do you avoid becoming "second Datadog"?
**答案/Answer**: Datadog是observability——metrics、logs、traces、dashboards。我们是operational coordination——routing、intervention、ownership、postmortem。我们consume Datadog output，不replace it。Datadog tells you what，我们tell you who。/ Datadog is observability—metrics, logs, traces, dashboards. We're operational coordination—routing, intervention, ownership, postmortem. We consume Datadog output, don't replace it. Datadog tells you what, we tell you who.

709.	如果客户没有成熟组织结构，你的 owner graph 从哪来？
If customer doesn't have mature org structure, where does your owner graph come from?
**答案/Answer**: Bootstrap从available sources：CODEOWNERS（code ownership）、git commit history（implicit ownership）、service deployment configs。不需要完美org chart。Start with what exists→iteratively improve。Some ownership > no ownership。/ Bootstrap from available sources: CODEOWNERS (code ownership), git commit history (implicit ownership), service deployment configs. Don't need perfect org chart. Start with what exists → iteratively improve. Some ownership > no ownership.

710.	如果客户组织结构每天变，你怎么跟上？
If customer org structure changes daily, how do you keep up?
**答案/Answer**: 自动sync from sources of truth（HR systems、CODEOWNERS files）。Manual overrides for exceptions。Flag stale ownership（owner left company etc.）。不需要perfect——"mostly right" routing比"no routing"好很多。/ Auto sync from sources of truth (HR systems, CODEOWNERS files). Manual overrides for exceptions. Flag stale ownership (owner left company etc.). Don't need perfect—"mostly right" routing is much better than "no routing."

711.	如果客户在并购整合中，owner 混乱，你的价值更高还是更低？
If customer is in M&A integration, ownership is chaotic, is your value higher or lower?
**答案/Answer**: 更高——混乱时更需要coordination。我们帮identify ownership gaps（"这个service没人claim"）、帮merged teams建立routing。混乱是我们的sweet spot。但也harder to sell因为他们忙于其他事。/ Higher—more need for coordination during chaos. We help identify ownership gaps ("this service has no one claiming it"), help merged teams establish routing. Chaos is our sweet spot. But also harder to sell because they're busy with other things.

712.	如果客户团队只 3 个人，为什么需要你？
If customer team is only 3 people, why do they need you?
**答案/Answer**: 可能不需要——3人team喊一声就行。我们的sweet spot是10+ people with agents。但如果3人team跑很多agents→可能需要visibility。Team size不是唯一factor，agent数量也重要。/ Probably don't need—3-person team can just yell. Our sweet spot is 10+ people with agents. But if 3-person team runs many agents → might need visibility. Team size isn't only factor, agent count matters too.

713.	如果客户团队 300 人，为什么不用现有大工具链？
If customer team is 300 people, why not use existing large toolchains?
**答案/Answer**: 现有工具链（ServiceNow/PagerDuty）不是为agent设计的。他们handle human-initiated incidents，不handle agent-speed actions。我们是complement not replace。"Your PagerDuty still works，我们在上游帮你更早知道。"/ Existing toolchains (ServiceNow/PagerDuty) aren't designed for agents. They handle human-initiated incidents, not agent-speed actions. We complement, not replace. "Your PagerDuty still works, we help you know earlier upstream."

714.	如果客户是初创且快，为什么愿意加一个新系统？
If customer is a fast startup, why would they add a new system?
**答案/Answer**: Fast startup用agents来move faster→agents会出问题→need visibility。我们是insurance。而且我们也是fast（30min integration）、不是heavy process。Match their speed。"Not another process, just visibility。"/ Fast startup uses agents to move faster → agents will cause problems → need visibility. We're insurance. And we're also fast (30min integration), not heavy process. Match their speed. "Not another process, just visibility."

715.	如果客户是大厂且慢，为什么愿意买一个新供应商？
If customer is a slow large company, why would they buy a new vendor?

Find right sponsor (AI Platform team usually has flexibility). Start small pilot → prove value → formal procurement. Large company pain points are bigger (more agents, more chaos); once in, stickier.

716.	你如何跨越这两个市场？
How do you cross both markets?
**答案/Answer**: PLG for startups、enterprise sales for large companies。同一个product、不同GTM motion。Startup先（fast feedback loops、product iteration）→enterprise later（larger deals、slower cycle）。Product serves both，motion differs。/ PLG for startups, enterprise sales for large companies. Same product, different GTM motion. Startup first (fast feedback loops, product iteration) → enterprise later (larger deals, slower cycle). Product serves both, motion differs.

717.	你选择先打哪一个？为什么？
Which one do you choose to target first? Why?

724.	你如何在 2 周内证明"不是你想象出来的组织问题"？
How do you prove "this isn't an organizational problem you imagined" within 2 weeks?
**答案/Answer**: Multiple sources confirmation：不同公司、不同roles都describe类似pain。如果只有一个人说有问题→可能是他们的特殊情况。10+人across 5+ companies saying similar things = real pattern not imagination。/ Multiple source confirmation: different companies, different roles all describe similar pain. If only one person says there's a problem → might be their special case. 10+ people across 5+ companies saying similar things = real pattern, not imagination.

725.	你如何在 2 周内证明"不是 Slack 频道管理就能解决"？
How do you prove "this can't be solved by Slack channel management" within 2 weeks?
**答案/Answer**: 问："你们试过用Slack channels解决吗？为什么不work？"Typical answers："太多channels、不知道发哪个"、"channel里没人响应"、"没有ownership mapping"。Slack solves notification，不solve routing。/ Ask: "Have you tried solving this with Slack channels? Why doesn't it work?" Typical answers: "Too many channels, don't know which to post in", "No one responds in channel", "No ownership mapping". Slack solves notification, not routing.

726.	你如何在 2 周内证明"不是写文档就能解决"？
How do you prove "this can't be solved by writing documentation" within 2 weeks?
**答案/Answer**: 问："你们有文档吗？有帮助吗？"Typical answers："文档过期了"、"incidents时没人看文档"、"文档说找谁但那人离职了"。Documentation is static，incidents是dynamic。Real-time > docs。/ Ask: "Do you have documentation? Does it help?" Typical answers: "Docs are outdated", "No one reads docs during incidents", "Docs say who to find but that person left". Documentation is static, incidents are dynamic. Real-time > docs.

727.	你如何在 2 周内证明"不是 PagerDuty 配置就能解决"？
How do you prove "this can't be solved by PagerDuty configuration" within 2 weeks?

768.	你如何回应"你不过是在做一个 postmortem generator"的质疑？
How do you respond to "you're just making a postmortem generator"?
**答案/Answer**: Postmortem是output之一——我们的核心是real-time routing和intervention。Postmortem是learning loop一部分，不是main value。如果只做postmortem generator我们会这样定位。/ Postmortem is one output—our core is real-time routing and intervention. Postmortem is part of learning loop, not main value. If we were just postmortem generator we'd position that way.

769.	你如何回应"你不过是在做一个 governance permission tool"的质疑？
How do you respond to "you're just making a governance permission tool"?
**答案/Answer**: Permission tool是static access control。我们是dynamic operational coordination。Permission = "谁能做"。我们 = "谁应该know + 谁应该act + 如何从错误学习"。完全不同的问题。/ Permission tool is static access control. We're dynamic operational coordination. Permission = "who can do". We = "who should know + who should act + how to learn from mistakes". Completely different problem.

770.	你如何回应"你不过是在做一个 backup/rewind tool"的质疑？
How do you respond to "you're just making a backup/rewind tool"?
**答案/Answer**: Backup/rewind是Rubrik做的——data snapshot restore。我们不做data backup。我们做coordination：知道谁应该介入、怎么介入。Recovery只是我们支持的路径之一，不是核心。/ Backup/rewind is what Rubrik does—data snapshot restore. We don't do data backup. We do coordination: knowing who should intervene, how to intervene. Recovery is just one path we support, not the core.

Before/after comparison. Customer's own data speaks. Not claiming improvement—showing data. If data doesn't improve → product has problems.

776.	你如何回应"你 8–12 周是胡说"的质疑？
How do you respond to "your 8-12 week timeline is nonsense"?
**答案/Answer**: 8-12周是MVP not full product。MVP scope：MCP capture + basic routing + Slack notification + simple timeline UI。这是achievable scope。Full vision是years，但usable MVP是weeks。Scope definition是关键。/ 8-12 weeks is MVP not full product. MVP scope: MCP capture + basic routing + Slack notification + simple timeline UI. This is achievable scope. Full vision is years, but usable MVP is weeks. Scope definition is key.

777.	你如何回应"你做完也没人买"的质疑？
How do you respond to "even if you build it, no one will buy"?
**答案/Answer**: Market validation ongoing：interview data、LOIs、competitor funding（Rubrik做这个说明market exists）。不是我觉得有人买——是data说有人买。如果pilot后没人付钱→pivot or kill。/ Market validation ongoing: interview data, LOIs, competitor funding (Rubrik doing this shows market exists). Not that I think people will buy—data says people will buy. If no one pays after pilot → pivot or kill.

778.	你如何回应"你会被合规拖死"的质疑？
How do you respond to "you'll be killed by compliance"?
**答案/Answer**: 合规是table stakes not differentiator——所有SaaS都得做。我们：SOC2 Type I早做、standard DPA、基础security controls。不over-engineer compliance，但不skip。Mid-market先，enterprise compliance后。/ Compliance is table stakes not differentiator—all SaaS must do. We: SOC2 Type I early, standard DPA, basic security controls. Don't over-engineer compliance, but don't skip. Mid-market first, enterprise compliance later.

779.	你如何回应"你会被支持成本拖死"的质疑？
How do you respond to "you'll be killed by support costs"?

1053.	你如何检测"通知漏发"并自动补发？
How do you detect "missed notification" and auto-resend?
**答案/Answer**: Reconciliation job: events that should have notified but didn't。Check notification log vs event log。Missing = resend (with "delayed" flag)。Run periodically。/ Reconciliation job: events that should have notified but didn't. Check notification log vs event log. Missing = resend (with "delayed" flag). Run periodically.

1054.	你如何定义漏发的判定时间窗口？
How do you define the time window for judging missed notifications?
**答案/Answer**: Window = max expected latency + buffer (e.g., 5 min)。Event older than window without notification = missed。Too short = false positives。Too long = delayed detection。/ Window = max expected latency + buffer (e.g., 5 min). Event older than window without notification = missed. Too short = false positives. Too long = delayed detection.

1055.	你如何防止补发造成 spam？
How do you prevent resend from causing spam?
**答案/Answer**: Mark as "delayed resend" in notification。Aggregate multiple delayed into one。Dedup against recently sent。Rate limit resends。Don't resend very old events。/ Mark as "delayed resend" in notification. Aggregate multiple delayed into one. Dedup against recently sent. Rate limit resends. Don't resend very old events.

1056.	你如何做"聚合通知"：N 条合成 1 条？
How do you do "aggregate notification": combine N into 1?

Time window for batching (e.g., 1 min). Summary: "5 events from service X in last minute." Link to details.

1057.	你如何定义聚合键？
How do you define aggregation key?
**答案/Answer**: Default: (service, severity, action_type)。Custom per rule。Configurable by customer。Good aggregation key = events that should be handled together。/ Default: (service, severity, action_type). Custom per rule. Configurable by customer. Good aggregation key = events that should be handled together.

1058.	你如何避免聚合导致丢关键细节？
How do you avoid aggregation losing key details?
**答案/Answer**: Summary highlights most severe/important。Full list available via click。Critical events never aggregated (or highlighted in summary)。Balance: reduce noise but don't hide important。/ Summary highlights most severe/important. Full list available via click. Critical events never aggregated (or highlighted in summary). Balance: reduce noise but don't hide important.

1059.	你如何在 UI 中展开聚合并快速定位关键事件？
How do you expand aggregation in UI and quickly locate key events?
**答案/Answer**: Collapsible group in UI。Expand shows all events sorted by importance/time。Filter within group。Highlight top N critical events at top。/ Collapsible group in UI. Expand shows all events sorted by importance/time. Filter within group. Highlight top N critical events at top.

1060.	你如何把 incident timeline 压缩成 3 行摘要？
How do you compress incident timeline into 3-line summary?
**答案/Answer**: Template: Line 1: What happened (error type + severity)。Line 2: Impact (services affected + duration)。Line 3: Status (resolved/ongoing + who's handling)。Automated extraction from structured data。/ Template: Line 1: What happened (error type + severity). Line 2: Impact (services affected + duration). Line 3: Status (resolved/ongoing + who's handling). Automated extraction from structured data.

Q2. 50 字描述 / 定位（20）
Q2. 50-word description / positioning (20)
1091.	"Helps teams intervene at agent speed" 具体是什么意思？
What does "Helps teams intervene at agent speed" specifically mean?
**答案/Answer**: Agent每秒能执行多个actions。人类无法逐一审批。我们让人类知道找谁、该做什么、影响范围——在需要时能快速介入，而不是阻塞每个action。/ Agents execute multiple actions per second. Humans can't approve each one. We let humans know who to call, what to do, blast radius—so they can intervene fast when needed, not block every action.

1092.	你如何用一个具体场景解释这句话？
How do you explain this with a specific scenario?
**答案/Answer**: Agent删除了生产DB的一张表。30秒内：DBA收到通知（我们知道他owns this table）、incident被创建、recovery path已准备好。这就是intervention at agent speed。/ Agent deletes a production DB table. Within 30 seconds: DBA notified (we know he owns this table), incident created, recovery path ready. That's intervention at agent speed.

1093.	你如何避免这句话听起来像 slogan？
How do you avoid this sounding like a slogan?
**答案/Answer**: 用具体metric：TTI（Time-to-Intervention）。不是"fast"——是"30秒内知道找谁"。有数字、有场景、有before/after对比。/ Use specific metric: TTI (Time-to-Intervention). Not "fast"—"know who to call within 30 seconds." Has numbers, scenarios, before/after comparison.

1094.	你产品到底是"incident response"还是"agent ops"？
Is your product "incident response" or "agent ops"?
**答案/Answer**: Agent ops with incident response built in。我们不只是响应incidents——我们在action发生时就routing、tracking、attributing。Incident response是outcome，不是入口。/ Agent ops with incident response built in. We don't just respond to incidents—we route, track, attribute at action time. Incident response is outcome, not entry point.

1095.	你如果只能选一个类别，你选哪个？
If you could only choose one category, which?
**答案/Answer**: Agent ops。因为我们从action execution开始介入，不是从incident开始。Incident是downstream event。/ Agent ops. Because we intervene starting from action execution, not from incident. Incident is downstream event.

1096.	你如何把定位写得更像"可购买的东西"？
How do you make positioning sound more like "something purchasable"?
**答案/Answer**: "Operational coordination for autonomous agents"或"Agent incident management platform"。有category、有buyer、有budget line item。/ "Operational coordination for autonomous agents" or "Agent incident management platform." Has category, buyer, budget line item.

1097.	你的 buyer 会在预算里把你归到哪一类？
Which budget category would your buyer put you in?
**答案/Answer**: 要么DevOps tooling（和Datadog一起），要么AI platform infrastructure（和agent runtime一起）。取决于公司org structure。/ Either DevOps tooling (alongside Datadog) or AI platform infrastructure (alongside agent runtime). Depends on company org structure.

1098.	你如何避免被当成 "nice-to-have" ？
How do you avoid being seen as "nice-to-have"?
**答案/Answer**: 绑定痛苦事件：上次agent搞砸花了多久找到root cause？花了多久联系到对的人？这些时间是真金白银。没有我们，下次还是一样。/ Tie to painful events: Last time agent messed up, how long to find root cause? How long to reach right person? That time is real money. Without us, next time is the same.

1099.	你产品的核心价值单位是什么？分钟？事故次数？金钱？
What's your product's core value unit? Minutes? Incident count? Money?
**答案/Answer**: Time-to-Intervention (TTI)，单位是秒/分钟。TTI低→MTTR低→downtime cost低。TTI是可测量的leading indicator。/ Time-to-Intervention (TTI), unit is seconds/minutes. Low TTI → low MTTR → low downtime cost. TTI is measurable leading indicator.

1100.	你如何量化 agent speed 带来的新风险？
How do you quantify the new risk from agent speed?
**答案/Answer**: Actions per hour × blast radius per action × human detection delay。传统：10 deploys/day。现在：100 actions/hour。Detection delay不变→风险敞口扩大10倍。/ Actions per hour × blast radius per action × human detection delay. Traditional: 10 deploys/day. Now: 100 actions/hour. Detection delay unchanged → risk exposure 10x.

1101.	你如何解释"我们不阻塞执行"不会显得危险？
How do you explain "we don't block execution" without sounding dangerous?
**答案/Answer**: 阻塞=人工审批bottleneck=agent变慢→部署agent的ROI消失。我们不是不管危险action——是用monitoring+fast intervention替代blocking。更快知道、更快修。/ Blocking = human approval bottleneck = agent slows down → ROI of deploying agents disappears. We don't ignore dangerous actions—we replace blocking with monitoring + fast intervention. Know faster, fix faster.

1102.	你如何证明"阻塞才是危险"（因为人工 bottleneck）？
How do you prove "blocking is the danger" (because of human bottleneck)?
**答案/Answer**: 如果每个action都要审批：1）队列积压→humans batch approve without reading。2）或者agents idle等待→失去价值。审批疲劳比不审批更危险。/ If every action needs approval: 1) Queue backs up → humans batch approve without reading. 2) Or agents idle waiting → lose value. Approval fatigue is more dangerous than no approval.

1103.	你如何定义"intervention routing"与"approval"边界？
How do you define the boundary between "intervention routing" and "approval"?
**答案/Answer**: Approval: action执行前必须人工说yes才能继续。Routing: action执行后（或执行时），系统决定谁应该know、谁应该被notified、什么recovery path可用。不阻塞，但确保可介入。/ Approval: human must say yes before action can proceed. Routing: after (or during) action execution, system decides who should know, who should be notified, what recovery paths available. No blocking, but ensure intervenability.

1104.	你如何用一句话让面试官瞬间懂差别？
How do you make interviewer instantly understand the difference in one sentence?
**答案/Answer**: "Approval asks 'should this happen'. Routing asks 'who needs to know it happened'."审批问该不该做，routing问谁该知道。/ "Approval asks 'should this happen'. Routing asks 'who needs to know it happened'."

1105.	你能否给一个反例：什么是 approval，你不做？
Can you give a counter-example: what is approval that you don't do?
**答案/Answer**: Agent要删DB table→暂停执行→发给DBA审批→DBA点approve才执行。我们不做这个。这让agent变成"需要人工批准的脚本"。/ Agent wants to delete DB table → pause execution → send to DBA for approval → DBA clicks approve before execution. We don't do this. This turns agent into "script that needs human approval."

1106.	你能否给一个正例：什么是 routing，你做？
Can you give an example: what is routing that you do?
**答案/Answer**: Agent删了DB table→执行完成→我们立刻：通知DBA（owner）、创建incident、提供recovery options（restore from backup）、记录为learning material。不阻塞，但全程可追踪可介入。/ Agent deleted DB table → execution completed → we immediately: notify DBA (owner), create incident, provide recovery options (restore from backup), record as learning material. No blocking, but fully trackable and intervenable.

1107.	你的 tagline 如果换成更具体的，会是什么？
If your tagline were more specific, what would it be?
**答案/Answer**: "Know who to call when agents break things"或"Incident response infrastructure for agent-driven systems"。更具体、更buyer-friendly。/ "Know who to call when agents break things" or "Incident response infrastructure for agent-driven systems." More specific, more buyer-friendly.

1108.	你愿不愿意承认你其实在做"on-call for agents"？
Are you willing to admit you're actually doing "on-call for agents"?
**答案/Answer**: 是的，可以这么说。On-call for agents = 谁应该在agent出问题时被call到。这是简单、可理解的定位。/ Yes, could say that. On-call for agents = who should be called when agent messes up. Simple, understandable positioning.

1109.	如果承认，这会带来什么优势/劣势？
If you admit it, what advantages/disadvantages?
**答案/Answer**: 优势：立刻有mental model（大家都懂on-call）。劣势：可能被归类为PagerDuty competitor而不是新category。我选择承认——先被理解比创造新category更重要。/ Advantage: instant mental model (everyone understands on-call). Disadvantage: might be categorized as PagerDuty competitor not new category. I choose to admit—being understood first matters more than creating new category.

1110.	如果不承认，你怎么解释？
If you don't admit it, how do you explain?
**答案/Answer**: "我们是agent coordination layer，on-call是其中一个功能"。但这会让定位变模糊。不如直接承认然后expand。/ "We're agent coordination layer, on-call is one feature." But this makes positioning fuzzy. Better to admit then expand.
Q3. Progress / pivot 叙事（30）
Q3. Progress / pivot narrative (30)
1111.	你 pivot 的三次每一次"错误假设"分别是什么？
What was the "wrong assumption" in each of your three pivots?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1112.	第一次（审批）错在哪里？证据是什么？
What was wrong with the first pivot (approval)? What's the evidence?
**答案/Answer**: 错误假设：pre-action approval能解决问题。证据：approval成为bottleneck，agent失去速度优势。Ask human before execute → lose the point of having agents。/ Wrong assumption: pre-action approval solves the problem. Evidence: approval becomes bottleneck, agents lose speed advantage. Ask human before execute → lose the point of having agents.

1113.	第二次（回滚/重放）错在哪里？证据是什么？
What was wrong with the second pivot (rollback/replay)? What's the evidence?
**答案/Answer**: 错误假设：完美rollback能解决问题。证据：很多action不可逆（emails sent, APIs called）。Rollback的核心资源不是技术，是谁知道怎么修。/ Wrong assumption: perfect rollback solves the problem. Evidence: many actions are irreversible (emails sent, APIs called). Rollback's core resource isn't tech, it's who knows how to fix.

1114.	第三次（协调）为什么更接近真相？证据是什么？
Why is the third pivot (coordination) closer to truth? What's the evidence?
**答案/Answer**: 真实事故分析：大部分问题不是没人能修，是不知道找谁、从哪开始。xAI视频里明确说这个。这是operational coordination问题，不是技术问题。/ Real incident analysis: most problems aren't about no one being able to fix, but not knowing who to find, where to start. xAI video explicitly says this. This is operational coordination problem, not technical problem.

1115.	你是不是被 xAI 视频"说服"而不是"验证"？
Were you "convinced" rather than "validated" by the xAI video?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1116.	你如何证明你做了独立验证？
How do you prove you did independent validation?

1118.	你的设计有没有写成 spec？多长？
Is your design written as a spec? How long?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1119.	设计里哪些部分最可能在真实客户上被推翻？
Which parts of the design are most likely to be disproved with real customers?
**答案/Answer**: 最可能被推翻：ownership graph的粒度、默认routing rules、pattern detection算法。这些需要真实数据才知道对不对。核心架构（event→route→intervene→learn）不太会变。/ Most likely to be disproved: ownership graph granularity, default routing rules, pattern detection algorithm. Need real data to know if right. Core architecture (event → route → intervene → learn) unlikely to change.

1120.	你是否愿意承诺：上线后会删掉 50% 的设计？
Are you willing to commit: you'll delete 50% of the design after launch?
**答案/Answer**: 是的。设计是hypothesis，不是commitment。50%被删掉说明我们在学习。比坚持100%的设计更好。/ Yes. Design is hypothesis, not commitment. 50% deleted means we're learning. Better than sticking to 100% of design.

1121.	你如何避免因为设计太完整反而难以 pivot？
How do you avoid being too complete in design making it hard to pivot?
**答案/Answer**: 核心架构和feature设计分开。核心架构（event flow）是stable的。Feature设计（哪些rules、哪些UI）是disposable的。只build必须验证的部分。/ Separate core architecture from feature design. Core architecture (event flow) is stable. Feature design (which rules, which UI) is disposable. Only build what must be validated.

1122.	你 8–12 周时间里，最先上线的 2 个功能是什么？
In your 8-12 weeks, what are the first 2 features to go live?
**答案/Answer**: 1）Event ingestion + real-time dashboard（看到所有agent actions）。2）Ownership-based routing（事件发生→通知owner）。这两个验证核心价值：visibility + who to call。/ 1) Event ingestion + real-time dashboard (see all agent actions). 2) Ownership-based routing (event happens → notify owner). These two validate core value: visibility + who to call.

1123.	你如何把"学习 loop"做成 v1？
How do you build "learning loop" as v1?
**答案/Answer**: v1 learning loop = manual postmortem → tagged patterns → rules建议。不需要ML。人工标记"这类事件下次要高优通知"→系统记住→下次自动route。/ v1 learning loop = manual postmortem → tagged patterns → rule suggestions. No ML needed. Human marks "this type of event should be high priority next time" → system remembers → auto-routes next time.

1124.	你如何把"postmortem automation"做成 v1？
How do you build "postmortem automation" as v1?
**答案/Answer**: v1 = 自动生成incident timeline（从events）+ 模板化问题（what happened, who was involved, what was impact）。不是AI生成答案——是structured data extraction。/ v1 = auto-generate incident timeline (from events) + templated questions (what happened, who was involved, what was impact). Not AI generating answers—structured data extraction.

1125.	你如何把"who to call"做成 v1？
How do you build "who to call" as v1?
**答案/Answer**: v1 = ownership config（谁owns哪些resources）+ routing rules（event type X → notify owner Y）。Config-driven，不是ML-driven。客户自己定义ownership。/ v1 = ownership config (who owns which resources) + routing rules (event type X → notify owner Y). Config-driven, not ML-driven. Customers define their own ownership.

1126.	v1 不准做什么（明确不做清单）？
What is v1 NOT allowed to do (explicit not-do list)?
**答案/Answer**: 不做：AI自动判断severity、predictive alerting、自动修复execution、complex dependency graph analysis、multi-tenant shared infrastructure。这些都是scale问题。/ Not doing: AI auto-judging severity, predictive alerting, auto-fix execution, complex dependency graph analysis, multi-tenant shared infrastructure. These are scale problems.

1127.	你如何定义 MVP 的验收标准？
How do you define MVP acceptance criteria?
**答案/Answer**: MVP验收：1个客户的agent actions能被ingested、routed to right person、形成incident timeline。客户说"这比我们之前的方式快"。不需要完美——需要比现状好。/ MVP acceptance: 1 customer's agent actions can be ingested, routed to right person, form incident timeline. Customer says "this is faster than what we had." Doesn't need to be perfect—needs to be better than status quo.

1128.	你如何让 demo 不依赖真实客户数据？
How do you make demo not depend on real customer data?
**答案/Answer**: 模拟场景：fake agent执行一系列actions（read file, modify config, call API, delete something）。展示：events appear real-time → routing to owner → incident created → recovery options shown。数据是synthetic但flow是真的。/ Simulated scenario: fake agent executes series of actions (read file, modify config, call API, delete something). Show: events appear real-time → routing to owner → incident created → recovery options shown. Data is synthetic but flow is real.

1129.	你如何构造一个可信的模拟场景？
How do you construct a credible simulated scenario?
**答案/Answer**: 基于真实incident report：agent误删production table。场景：coding agent receives task → executes DROP TABLE → our system detects → routes to DBA → shows blast radius → offers recovery。每一步都是realistic。/ Based on real incident report: agent accidentally deletes production table. Scenario: coding agent receives task → executes DROP TABLE → our system detects → routes to DBA → shows blast radius → offers recovery. Every step is realistic.

1130.	你如何证明 demo 的场景不是刻意挑简单的？
How do you prove demo scenario isn't cherry-picked to be easy?
**答案/Answer**: 选常见high-impact场景，不是edge case：DB modification、config change、API call with side effects。这些是真实客户最担心的，不是我挑的最简单的。/ Choose common high-impact scenarios, not edge cases: DB modification, config change, API call with side effects. These are what real customers worry about most, not what I picked as easiest.

1131.	你如何向 YC 解释"还没实现"的风险？
How do you explain to YC the risk of "not yet implemented"?
**答案/Answer**: 坦诚：目前是design + architecture + partial prototype。风险是execution。但：每个component都是已解决的技术问题。MCP, WebSocket, event routing都有成熟方案。风险不在能不能做——在于多快做完。/ Honest: currently design + architecture + partial prototype. Risk is execution. But: every component is solved technical problem. MCP, WebSocket, event routing all have mature solutions. Risk isn't if we can build—it's how fast.

1132.	你如何向 YC 解释"我能很快做出来"的依据？
How do you explain to YC the basis for "I can build it quickly"?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1133.	你如何把进度讲得既诚实又有冲击力？
How do you present progress both honestly and impactfully?
**答案/Answer**: "Design complete, architecture validated, core components prototyped. What's missing is integration and polish—not figuring out what to build."已经知道做什么，缺的是时间把它做完。/ "Design complete, architecture validated, core components prototyped. What's missing is integration and polish—not figuring out what to build."

How do you explain you currently have no product link/no video?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1136.	你如何在申请周期内补上最关键的一个 artifact？
How do you add the most critical artifact within the application cycle?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1137.	你能在 72 小时内补一个最小 demo 吗？是什么？
Can you add a minimal demo in 72 hours? What would it be?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1138.	你如果只能补一段视频，你会展示什么？
If you could only add one video, what would you show?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1139.	你如何让视频里出现"真实痛点"而不是炫技？
How do you make the video show "real pain points" instead of showing off tech?
**答案/Answer**: 开头讲问题（agent删了东西，花了2小时才知道谁该修），然后展示解决（30秒内通知到对的人）。不讲技术细节——讲before/after的时间差。/ Start with problem (agent deleted something, took 2 hours to know who should fix), then show solution (notify right person within 30 seconds). Don't explain tech details—show before/after time difference.

1140.	你如何让视频证明你理解客户而不是只懂工程？
How do you make video prove you understand customers not just engineering?
**答案/Answer**: 用客户的语言：不说"event routing"说"找对的人"。不说"blast radius"说"影响了哪些服务"。展示的是workflow improvement，不是系统架构。/ Use customer language: don't say "event routing" say "find the right person." Don't say "blast radius" say "which services were affected." Show workflow improvement, not system architecture.
Q4. 市场验证与竞争（30）
Q4. Market validation and competition (30)
1141.	你引用 Rubrik/Datadog 作为验证，你能说出它们具体解决的是什么吗？
You cite Rubrik/Datadog as validation—can you say specifically what they solve?
**答案/Answer**: Rubrik解决：agent破坏后的数据恢复（snapshot restore）。Datadog解决：agent行为的可见性（observability, traces）。两者验证了问题存在，但都是partial solution。/ Rubrik solves: data recovery after agent damage (snapshot restore). Datadog solves: visibility into agent behavior (observability, traces). Both validate problem exists, but both are partial solutions.

1142.	你能说出它们产品不解决的是什么吗？
Can you say what their products don't solve?
**答案/Answer**: 都不解决："找谁修"和"怎么不再犯"。Rubrik只恢复数据，不routing to owner。Datadog只显示发生了什么，不提供intervention capability。/ Neither solves: "who to call" and "how to not repeat." Rubrik only restores data, no routing to owner. Datadog only shows what happened, no intervention capability.

1143.	你如何证明"他们解决了错误版本"？
How do you prove "they solved the wrong version"?
**答案/Answer**: 真实incident分析：大部分时间花在"找对的人"而不是"技术修复"。Rubrik假设问题是rollback，但问题是coordination。Datadog假设问题是visibility，但问题是actionability。/ Real incident analysis: most time spent on "finding right person" not "technical fix." Rubrik assumes problem is rollback, but problem is coordination. Datadog assumes problem is visibility, but problem is actionability.

1144.	你如何避免被反驳：他们只是在走路线图，迟早会做到？
How do you avoid being countered: they're just executing roadmap and will get there eventually?
**答案/Answer**: DNA决定优先级。Rubrik的DNA是backup，会持续优化snapshot。Datadog的DNA是observability，会持续优化traces。Coordination layer不是他们的core business，是nice-to-have feature。我们是core。/ DNA determines priority. Rubrik's DNA is backup, will keep optimizing snapshots. Datadog's DNA is observability, will keep optimizing traces. Coordination layer isn't their core business, it's nice-to-have feature. For us it's core.

1145.	你如何证明他们做不到你做的？
How do you prove they can't do what you do?
**答案/Answer**: 不是"做不到"——是"不会优先做"。大公司有千个feature requests，coordination layer排在后面。而且做好coordination需要重新设计数据模型（ownership graph），不是加feature。/ Not "can't do"—"won't prioritize." Big companies have thousands of feature requests, coordination layer ranks low. And doing coordination well requires redesigning data model (ownership graph), not adding features.

1146.	你如何证明你做的是更核心的 wedge？
How do you prove what you do is a more core wedge?
**答案/Answer**: Visibility（Datadog）和Recovery（Rubrik）都依赖Coordination。如果不知道找谁，再好的visibility也没用。如果不知道该不该rollback，rollback能力也没用。Coordination是中间层。/ Visibility (Datadog) and Recovery (Rubrik) both depend on Coordination. Best visibility is useless if you don't know who to call. Rollback capability is useless if you don't know whether to rollback. Coordination is the middle layer.

1147.	你如何防止他们复制你的"路由+学习 loop"？
How do you prevent them from copying your "routing + learning loop"?
**答案/Answer**: 不能防止copy——但能win on execution speed和product focus。大公司加feature慢（要过很多stakeholders）。我们整个公司就做这一件事。先占领customer mind share。/ Can't prevent copy—but can win on execution speed and product focus. Big companies add features slowly (many stakeholders to pass). Our whole company does this one thing. Capture customer mind share first.

1148.	你是否有一个你认为他们永远做不好的点？是什么？
Is there something you think they'll never do well? What is it?
**答案/Answer**: Ownership graph maintenance。谁owns什么是动态变化的（人员变动、组织变化）。Datadog不会让你在里面管理org structure。Rubrik不关心who should know。这需要dedicated product focus。/ Ownership graph maintenance. Who owns what changes dynamically (personnel changes, org changes). Datadog won't let you manage org structure inside it. Rubrik doesn't care who should know. This needs dedicated product focus.

1149.	你如何定义你的差异不是 marketing，而是结构性差异？
How do you define your difference as structural not just marketing?
**答案/Answer**: 结构性差异：数据模型不同。我们的核心entity是ownership relationship（谁owns什么resource）。Datadog的核心entity是trace/metric。Rubrik的核心entity是snapshot。不是加feature能解决的。/ Structural difference: different data model. Our core entity is ownership relationship (who owns what resource). Datadog's core entity is trace/metric. Rubrik's core entity is snapshot. Can't be solved by adding features.

1150.	你如何描述你与 Datadog 的关系：补充还是替代？
How do you describe your relationship with Datadog: complement or replace?
**答案/Answer**: 补充。Datadog提供原始observability data，我们consume这些data并加上coordination layer。Customer用Datadog看发生了什么，用我们决定该通知谁、该做什么。/ Complement. Datadog provides raw observability data, we consume that data and add coordination layer. Customer uses Datadog to see what happened, uses us to decide who to notify, what to do.

1151.	你如何描述你与 Rubrik 的关系：补充还是替代？
How do you describe your relationship with Rubrik: complement or replace?
**答案/Answer**: 部分替代、部分补充。我们的recovery options可以调用Rubrik的rollback能力。但我们提供Rubrik没有的：pre-action routing和learning loop。对于只要rollback的客户，Rubrik够用；要coordination的找我们。/ Partial replace, partial complement. Our recovery options can call Rubrik's rollback capability. But we provide what Rubrik doesn't: pre-action routing and learning loop. Customers who only need rollback, Rubrik is enough; those who need coordination come to us.

1152.	你如何切入他们现有客户：合作还是竞争？
How do you penetrate their existing customers: cooperation or competition?
**答案/Answer**: 合作。他们的客户已经在用Datadog/Rubrik，我们是add-on不是rip-and-replace。"你已经有visibility了，现在加上coordination。"降低adoption friction。/ Cooperation. Their customers already use Datadog/Rubrik, we're add-on not rip-and-replace. "You already have visibility, now add coordination." Lower adoption friction.

1153.	你愿意做 Datadog 插件吗？为什么？
Would you be willing to be a Datadog plugin? Why?
**答案/Answer**: 早期可以。Plugin = distribution channel。用Datadog marketplace获取客户，证明价值，然后expand。风险是被dependent on Datadog's platform decisions。但早期distribution比independence更重要。/ Early stage yes. Plugin = distribution channel. Use Datadog marketplace to acquire customers, prove value, then expand. Risk is being dependent on Datadog's platform decisions. But early-stage distribution matters more than independence.

1154.	你愿意做 Rubrik 插件吗？为什么？
Would you be willing to be a Rubrik plugin? Why?
**答案/Answer**: Less likely。Rubrik客户是enterprise，sales cycle长。而且Rubrik的value prop是"one platform"，less likely to encourage plugins。更好的策略：Rubrik客户先用我们standalone，再考虑integration。/ Less likely. Rubrik customers are enterprise, long sales cycle. And Rubrik's value prop is "one platform," less likely to encourage plugins. Better strategy: Rubrik customers use us standalone first, then consider integration.

1155.	你最早的分发渠道是什么？
What's your earliest distribution channel?
**答案/Answer**: Developer communities（Discord, Twitter, HN）和agent framework ecosystems（LangChain, AutoGPT communities）。这些人已经在用agents，最先遇到coordination问题。Direct outreach to teams building with agents。/ Developer communities (Discord, Twitter, HN) and agent framework ecosystems (LangChain, AutoGPT communities). These people already use agents, first to encounter coordination problems. Direct outreach to teams building with agents.

1156.	你怎么拿到第一批 design partner？
How do you get the first batch of design partners?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1157.	你如何把"协调层"卖给谁：SRE 还是 AI platform？
Who do you sell "coordination layer" to: SRE or AI platform?
**答案/Answer**: AI platform team first。他们部署agents，他们负责agent出问题后的后果。SRE可能觉得这是AI team的事。AI platform team has direct pain。/ AI platform team first. They deploy agents, they're responsible for consequences when agents mess up. SRE might think this is AI team's problem. AI platform team has direct pain.

1158.	谁的预算里会出钱？
Whose budget does the money come from?
**答案/Answer**: AI platform / ML infra budget。或者engineering tooling budget（和Datadog一个bucket）。取决于公司org——去找谁有agent deployment的KPI。/ AI platform / ML infra budget. Or engineering tooling budget (same bucket as Datadog). Depends on company org—find who has agent deployment KPIs.

1159.	谁会 veto？
Who will veto?
**答案/Answer**: Security team（如果担心我们看到敏感data）或Finance（如果觉得已经有Datadog够了）。要提前address security concerns。要说清楚和Datadog的差异。/ Security team (if worried we see sensitive data) or Finance (if thinks Datadog is enough). Need to pre-address security concerns. Need to clarify difference from Datadog.

1160.	你如何绕过 veto？
How do you bypass the veto?
**答案/Answer**: Security veto：on-prem option或SOC2 compliance证明。Finance veto：算ROI——降低MTTR的时间×工程师时薪。让buyer自己去convince veto stakeholder。/ Security veto: on-prem option or SOC2 compliance proof. Finance veto: calculate ROI—reduced MTTR time × engineer hourly rate. Let buyer convince veto stakeholder themselves.

1161.	你如何回答"我们不想再加一个新工具"？
How do you answer "we don't want to add another tool"?
**答案/Answer**: 理解。但问一个问题：上次agent出问题，花了多久找到对的人？如果答案是"很久"，那就是tool gap。我们不是adding noise——是减少coordination time。/ Understand. But one question: last time agent had issue, how long to find right person? If answer is "long time," that's a tool gap. We're not adding noise—reducing coordination time.

1162.	你如何回答"我们自己写一个 bot 就行"？
How do you answer "we can just write a bot ourselves"?
**答案/Answer**: 可以写notification bot。但：ownership graph怎么维护？learning loop怎么做？postmortem怎么自动化？你愿意花多少工程时间维护这个bot？我们让你专注在core product。/ Can write notification bot. But: how do you maintain ownership graph? How do you do learning loop? How do you automate postmortem? How much engineering time to maintain this bot? We let you focus on core product.

1163.	你如何回答"这应该由平台团队自己做"？
How do you answer "this should be done by platform team themselves"?
**答案/Answer**: 平台团队已经够忙了（maintain agent infra, model serving等）。Coordination layer是specialized problem。和平台团队讨论："你们有bandwidth做这个吗？维护ownership graph？learning loop？"通常答案是没有。/ Platform team is busy enough (maintain agent infra, model serving, etc.). Coordination layer is specialized problem. Discuss with platform team: "Do you have bandwidth for this? Maintain ownership graph? Learning loop?" Usually answer is no.

1164.	你如何回答"这应该由安全团队做"？
How do you answer "this should be done by security team"?
**答案/Answer**: Security team关心的是policy enforcement（agent能做什么）。我们关心的是operational coordination（agent做了之后谁该知道）。不同问题。Security team做guardrails，我们做incident response。可以互补。/ Security team cares about policy enforcement (what agents can do). We care about operational coordination (who should know after agent acts). Different problems. Security team does guardrails, we do incident response. Can complement.

1165.	你如何回答"这应该由 DataDog 做"？
How do you answer "this should be done by Datadog"?
**答案/Answer**: Datadog做了observability，但没做coordination。他们的roadmap里有"AI monitoring"但focus是traces/metrics，不是ownership routing。等他们做好可能要很久。我们现在就解决。/ Datadog did observability, but not coordination. Their roadmap has "AI monitoring" but focus is traces/metrics, not ownership routing. Waiting for them to build it could take very long. We solve it now.

1166.	你如何回答"这应该由 agent runtime 提供"？
How do you answer "this should be done by agent runtime"?
**答案/Answer**: Agent runtime (LangChain, AutoGPT) 的job是让agent跑起来，不是让人类能协调。他们可以提供hooks，但不会build full coordination platform。就像Kubernetes不会build PagerDuty。/ Agent runtime's (LangChain, AutoGPT) job is to make agents run, not to help humans coordinate. They can provide hooks, but won't build full coordination platform. Like Kubernetes doesn't build PagerDuty.

1167.	你如何回答"你没有生产经验，做不了"？
How do you answer "you have no production experience, can't do this"?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1169.	你如何回答"你没有合伙人，做不了"？
How do you answer "you have no co-founder, can't do this"?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1170.	你如何回答"你没用户，凭什么"？
How do you answer "you have no users, why should we trust you"?
**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]
Q5. 定价与商业模型（20）
Q5. Pricing and business model (20)
1171.	你 $50–100/agent/月 的依据是什么？
What's the basis for your $50-100/agent/month pricing?
**答案/Answer**: 参考Datadog per-host pricing (~$15-30) + premium for agent-specific capabilities。Agent比traditional service更dangerous（autonomous），值得premium。10个agent = $500-1000/月，对企业是noise。/ Reference Datadog per-host pricing (~$15-30) + premium for agent-specific capabilities. Agents more dangerous than traditional services (autonomous), worth premium. 10 agents = $500-1000/month, noise for enterprises.

1172.	你如何定义一个 agent（长寿/短寿/并发）才能计费公平？
How do you define an agent (long-lived/short-lived/concurrent) for fair billing?
**答案/Answer**: 按unique agent identity计费，不是by instance。Agent重启不算新agent。Concurrent instances of same agent算1个。Monthly active agents = distinct agent IDs that executed actions。/ Bill by unique agent identity, not by instance. Agent restart doesn't count as new agent. Concurrent instances of same agent count as 1. Monthly active agents = distinct agent IDs that executed actions.

1173.	你如何应对客户把 agent 数量拆分来逃费？
How do you handle customers splitting agent count to avoid fees?
**答案/Answer**: 定价要让splitting不worth it。如果单价够低（$50），客户不会花时间hack billing。而且：我们按actions also track，异常patterns可见。Trust but verify。/ Pricing should make splitting not worth it. If unit price low enough ($50), customers won't spend time hacking billing. And: we track by actions too, abnormal patterns visible. Trust but verify.

1174.	你如何应对客户说"我们几百个 agent 但只有少数关键"？
How do you handle "we have hundreds of agents but only few are critical"?
**答案/Answer**: Tier定价：critical agents full price，non-critical agents reduced rate。或：按"monitored agent"收费——只有你选择monitor的才收钱。让客户自己决定哪些important。/ Tiered pricing: critical agents full price, non-critical agents reduced rate. Or: charge by "monitored agent"—only charge for those you choose to monitor. Let customers decide what's important.

1175.	你是否要按 action 数收费？为什么？
Should you charge by action count? Why?
**答案/Answer**: 不作为primary metric。Action count波动大，客户难预测成本。而且会discourage客户report所有actions。我们want full visibility，不想让pricing阻止data ingestion。/ Not as primary metric. Action count fluctuates, hard for customers to predict cost. Also discourages customers from reporting all actions. We want full visibility, don't want pricing to block data ingestion.

1176.	你是否要按 routed action 数收费？为什么？
Should you charge by routed action count? Why?
**答案/Answer**: 可以作为secondary tier。Base price covers N routed actions/month，超过按usage计费。这align incentives：我们want better routing减少noise，不是更多routing。/ Can be secondary tier. Base price covers N routed actions/month, overage billed by usage. This aligns incentives: we want better routing to reduce noise, not more routing.

1177.	你是否要按 incident 数收费？为什么？
Should you charge by incident count? Why?
**答案/Answer**: 不好。Incident数多可能是客户系统unstable（他们更需要我们），收更多钱penalize他们。我们应该在客户improve时（fewer incidents）也能赚钱。Agent数是stable base。/ Not good. More incidents might mean customer system unstable (they need us more), charging more penalizes them. We should still make money when customer improves (fewer incidents). Agent count is stable base.

1178.	你的计费指标是否容易被客户质疑？
Is your billing metric easily challenged by customers?
**答案/Answer**: Agent count = 可验证（客户知道自己有几个agent）。不像"API calls"那样invisible。Dashboard显示当前active agents，客户可以自己check。Transparent = less disputes。/ Agent count = verifiable (customers know how many agents they have). Not like "API calls" which is invisible. Dashboard shows current active agents, customers can check themselves. Transparent = fewer disputes.

1179.	你如何让计费指标可验证？
How do you make billing metric verifiable?
**答案/Answer**: Dashboard实时显示：active agents list、monthly unique agent count、actions per agent。Export功能让客户自己审计。No black box billing。/ Dashboard shows real-time: active agents list, monthly unique agent count, actions per agent. Export feature lets customers audit themselves. No black box billing.

1180.	你如何避免计费驱动你做"更多通知"而不是"更少噪音"？
How do you avoid billing driving you to "more notifications" instead of "less noise"?
**答案/Answer**: 不按notification数收费。按agent数或seat数收费。我们的incentive = 客户success = 更少noise、更快response。Noise多了客户会churn。Customer success = our success。/ Don't charge by notification count. Charge by agent count or seat count. Our incentive = customer success = less noise, faster response. Too much noise, customers churn. Customer success = our success.

1181.	你如何对齐激励：你赚得多时客户也更好？
How do you align incentives: you earn more when customers are better off?
**答案/Answer**: 客户deploy更多agents→更需要coordination→pay more。客户agents更effective→deploy更多→pay more。我们不从客户pain中赚钱（incident count），从客户growth中赚钱（agent count）。/ Customers deploy more agents → need more coordination → pay more. Customers' agents more effective → deploy more → pay more. We don't earn from customer pain (incident count), we earn from customer growth (agent count).

1182.	你如何处理 free tier？会不会导致你成本爆炸？
How do you handle free tier? Will it cause cost explosion?
**答案/Answer**: Free tier：3 agents，7天 retention，limited features。Enough to try, not enough to run production。Cost capped per free account。Free users either convert or leave——不会无限consume。/ Free tier: 3 agents, 7-day retention, limited features. Enough to try, not enough to run production. Cost capped per free account. Free users either convert or leave—won't consume infinitely.

1183.	你如何控制 free tier 的滥用？
How do you control free tier abuse?
**答案/Answer**: Rate limits（events/hour）、storage limits、feature limits（no API access, no custom rules）。Abuse patterns detected→account flagged→upgrade prompt or terminate。Free tier是marketing cost，要controlled。/ Rate limits (events/hour), storage limits, feature limits (no API access, no custom rules). Abuse patterns detected → account flagged → upgrade prompt or terminate. Free tier is marketing cost, must be controlled.

1184.	你如何在早期定价不成熟时仍然成交？
How do you close deals when early-stage pricing isn't mature?
**答案/Answer**: Pilot pricing with flexibility。"Let's start at $X/month for 3 months, then we'll revisit based on your actual usage."降低commitment anxiety。Customer knows they're not locked in forever。/ Pilot pricing with flexibility. "Let's start at $X/month for 3 months, then we'll revisit based on your actual usage." Reduce commitment anxiety. Customer knows they're not locked in forever.

1185.	你如何用 pilot 定价（固定费/按月/按结果）？
How do you do pilot pricing (fixed/monthly/outcome-based)?
**答案/Answer**: 推荐：固定月费pilot。按结果太复杂（怎么定义success？）。固定费让双方专注validation不是billing。Pilot fee可以credited toward annual contract if convert。/ Recommend: fixed monthly fee pilot. Outcome-based too complex (how to define success?). Fixed fee lets both sides focus on validation not billing. Pilot fee can be credited toward annual contract if convert.

1186.	你如何防止 pilot 结束后客户不续？
How do you prevent customer not renewing after pilot ends?
**答案/Answer**: Pilot期间build dependency：ownership graph configured、rules tuned、team trained。Switching cost高。而且：pilot期间measure TTI improvement，renewal discussion有data。"Your TTI dropped from 2 hours to 15 minutes."/ Build dependency during pilot: ownership graph configured, rules tuned, team trained. Switching cost high. And: measure TTI improvement during pilot, renewal discussion has data. "Your TTI dropped from 2 hours to 15 minutes."

1187.	你如何把 pilot 转为长期合同？
How do you convert pilot to long-term contract?
**答案/Answer**: Pilot结束前review meeting：show metrics（TTI improvement, incidents handled）。Ask："你们还想回到之前的方式吗？"通常答案是no。Offer annual discount for commitment。/ Review meeting before pilot ends: show metrics (TTI improvement, incidents handled). Ask: "Do you want to go back to the old way?" Usually answer is no. Offer annual discount for commitment.

1188.	你如何处理客户要求"按年付 + 退款条款"？
How do you handle customer requesting "annual payment + refund clause"?
**答案/Answer**: 可以接受reasonable退款条款（如前3个月）。Annual discount换annual commitment。退款条款让客户less anxious about committing。但要time-bound——不能6个月后还能全额退。/ Can accept reasonable refund clause (e.g., first 3 months). Annual discount for annual commitment. Refund clause makes customer less anxious about committing. But must be time-bound—can't refund full amount 6 months later.

1189.	你如何处理客户要求 SLA？
How do you handle customer requesting SLA?
**答案/Answer**: 提供reasonable SLA：99.9% uptime、<5min alert delivery、24h support response。这些我们能做到。不promise我们做不到的。SLA violation = service credits not unlimited liability。/ Offer reasonable SLA: 99.9% uptime, <5min alert delivery, 24h support response. These we can do. Don't promise what we can't do. SLA violation = service credits not unlimited liability.

1190.	你如何在没有成熟团队时承诺 SLA？
How do you commit to SLA without a mature team?
**答案/Answer**: Conservative SLA to start（99.5% not 99.99%）。Cloud provider gives us foundation（managed DB, load balancing）。PagerDuty for our own on-call。Start modest, increase SLA as we mature。/ Conservative SLA to start (99.5% not 99.99%). Cloud provider gives us foundation (managed DB, load balancing). PagerDuty for our own on-call. Start modest, increase SLA as we mature.

1192.	你如何解释 "Toronto build, SF sell" 的操作可行性？
How do you explain the operational feasibility of "Toronto build, SF sell"?
**答案/Answer**: Build阶段不需要physical presence（remote engineering）。Sell阶段：SF trips for key meetings、YC network、video calls。很多YC公司这么做——build in low-cost city, sell in SF。/ Build phase doesn't need physical presence (remote engineering). Sell phase: SF trips for key meetings, YC network, video calls. Many YC companies do this—build in low-cost city, sell in SF.

R1. From Datadog's perspective (50)
1201.	你说我不做 execution governance，我完全可以加 routing，凭什么你赢？
You say I don't do execution governance—I can totally add routing. Why would you win?
**答案/Answer**: 你可以加routing feature，但routing不是你的core product。你有1000个feature requests，routing排在后面。而我整个公司就做这一件事。Product focus wins over feature addition。/ You can add routing feature, but routing isn't your core product. You have 1000 feature requests, routing ranks low. My whole company does this one thing. Product focus wins over feature addition.

1202.	你说我不做 incident response，我已有 PagerDuty 集成，为什么不够？
You say I don't do incident response—I already have PagerDuty integration. Why isn't that enough?
**答案/Answer**: PagerDuty集成解决alert routing。但agent actions需要：ownership graph for resources, blast radius calculation, learning loop。PagerDuty不知道agent改了什么，影响了谁。/ PagerDuty integration solves alert routing. But agent actions need: ownership graph for resources, blast radius calculation, learning loop. PagerDuty doesn't know what agent changed, who was affected.

1203.	你说"找不到谁做的"，我们有 audit trail，你是不是没看？
You say "can't find who did it"—we have audit trail. Did you even look?
**答案/Answer**: Audit trail回答"什么action发生了"。但不回答"谁应该被通知"和"该找谁来修"。你有data，但没有routing logic。Data without action is just logs。/ Audit trail answers "what action happened." But doesn't answer "who should be notified" and "who should fix it." You have data, but no routing logic. Data without action is just logs.

1204.	你说"找不到谁该被通知"，我们有 service ownership，你是不是低估了？
You say "can't find who should be notified"—we have service ownership. Did you underestimate us?
**答案/Answer**: Service ownership不等于resource ownership。Agent可能改config、写DB、call API——跨多个services。你的ownership是service级别，我的是resource级别。Granularity不同。/ Service ownership isn't resource ownership. Agent might change config, write DB, call API—across multiple services. Your ownership is service-level, mine is resource-level. Different granularity.

1205.	你凭什么认为"social capability"不是我能做的？
Why do you think "social capability" isn't something I can do?
**答案/Answer**: 你可以做social features（chat, @mention）。但social capability = 知道组织里谁owns什么，谁能修什么，这需要维护org structure。这不是你的core business，你不会投入资源优化它。/ You can do social features (chat, @mention). But social capability = knowing who owns what in org, who can fix what. This requires maintaining org structure. Not your core business, you won't invest in optimizing it.

1206.	你凭什么认为"who to call"不是客户内部流程问题？
Why do you think "who to call" isn't the customer's internal process problem?
**答案/Answer**: 客户内部流程确实是他们的责任。但agent让这个问题harder——速度快、变化多、blast radius不确定。我们帮助他们的流程scale to agent speed。不是替代流程，是accelerate流程。/ Customer internal process is indeed their responsibility. But agents make this problem harder—fast, many changes, uncertain blast radius. We help their processes scale to agent speed. Not replacing process, accelerating it.

1207.	你如何解释你不是在重复我已有功能？
How do you explain you're not duplicating my existing features?
**答案/Answer**: 你做observability（看发生了什么）。我做coordination（决定谁该知道、谁该做什么）。你的output是我的input。我们是downstream，不是duplicate。/ You do observability (see what happened). I do coordination (decide who should know, who should do what). Your output is my input. We're downstream, not duplicate.

1208.	你如何解释你不是在做一个 Datadog app？
How do you explain you're not just making a Datadog app?
**答案/Answer**: Datadog app会依赖你的data model和platform decisions。我需要独立的ownership graph、routing rules、learning loop。这些需要独立数据模型。App受限，product不受限。/ Datadog app would depend on your data model and platform decisions. I need independent ownership graph, routing rules, learning loop. These need independent data model. App is constrained, product isn't.

1209.	如果你是 Datadog app，你的护城河是什么？
If you were a Datadog app, what's your moat?
**答案/Answer**: 如果只是app：没有护城河，你随时可以build in-house。所以我不只是app——我有独立数据（ownership graph）、独立logic（routing rules）、独立value（learning loop）。/ If just an app: no moat, you can build in-house anytime. So I'm not just an app—I have independent data (ownership graph), independent logic (routing rules), independent value (learning loop).

1210.	如果我给你上架 marketplace，你愿意吗？会死吗？
If I put you on marketplace, would you accept? Would you die?
**答案/Answer**: 早期愿意——distribution比independence重要。但不会死，因为：我有独立value prop（coordination），不只是你的data wrapper。Marketplace是channel，不是product。我可以multi-channel。/ Early stage yes—distribution matters more than independence. But won't die, because: I have independent value prop (coordination), not just your data wrapper. Marketplace is channel, not product. I can multi-channel.

1211.	你为什么不直接做成 Datadog plugin？
Why don't you just become a Datadog plugin?
**答案/Answer**: Plugin = 受限于你的platform evolution、pricing、roadmap。如果你改API我就break。如果你raise price我就squeeze。独立product有控制权。Plugin可以是GTM strategy，不能是long-term strategy。/ Plugin = constrained by your platform evolution, pricing, roadmap. If you change API I break. If you raise price I'm squeezed. Independent product has control. Plugin can be GTM strategy, not long-term strategy.

1212.	你如何处理我们价格战：我免费给 routing？
How do you handle our price war: I give routing for free?
**答案/Answer**: 如果你免费给routing，说明routing对你是feature not product。你不会optimize it。我会继续投入做best-in-class routing。Customer选择取决于：好用 vs 免费。够painful的问题，customer pay for best solution。/ If you give routing free, it means routing is feature not product to you. You won't optimize it. I'll keep investing in best-in-class routing. Customer choice depends on: good vs free. Painful enough problems, customers pay for best solution.

1213.	你如何处理我们 bundling：我把你功能塞进现有套餐？
How do you handle our bundling: I put your features into existing package?
**答案/Answer**: Bundling会让你的routing是"good enough"而不是"best"。Customer用你的bundled version，发现不够好，会来找我。我的differentiator是depth，不是availability。/ Bundling makes your routing "good enough" not "best." Customers use your bundled version, find it insufficient, come to me. My differentiator is depth, not availability.

1214.	你如何处理我们的分发：我们已有巨大渠道？
How do you handle our distribution: we already have huge channels?
**答案/Answer**: 你的channel确实巨大。但你的channel sells observability，我sells coordination。你的sales不会hard-sell coordination——不是你的core。我的sales只sell coordination。Channel size matters, but focus matters more。/ Your channel is indeed huge. But your channel sells observability, I sell coordination. Your sales won't hard-sell coordination—not your core. My sales only sell coordination. Channel size matters, but focus matters more.

1215.	你如何防止自己变成 feature？
How do you prevent yourself from becoming a feature?
**答案/Answer**: Build depth that's hard to replicate as feature：ownership graph + learning loop + multi-strategy recovery。Features浅，products深。每个feature你要justify为什么投入resources，我不需要——这是我的whole product。/ Build depth that's hard to replicate as feature: ownership graph + learning loop + multi-strategy recovery. Features are shallow, products are deep. Every feature you need to justify resource investment, I don't—this is my whole product.

1216.	你说你更快更灵活，但客户要的是稳定，你怎么赢？
You say you're faster and more flexible, but customers want stability. How do you win?
**答案/Answer**: 稳定 = 不变。但agent world每天在变——new agents, new tools, new patterns。客户需要能跟上变化的coordination layer。你的stability是legacy，我的flexibility是必要的。/ Stability = not changing. But agent world changes daily—new agents, new tools, new patterns. Customers need coordination layer that keeps up with change. Your stability is legacy, my flexibility is necessary.

1217.	你说你不阻塞执行，但客户要 guardrails，你怎么解释？
You say you don't block execution, but customers want guardrails. How do you explain?
**答案/Answer**: Guardrails有两种：pre-execution blocking和post-execution accountability。我做后者。Blocking = bottleneck = defeats purpose of agents。Accountability = know who did what, intervene fast when needed。我提供real guardrails without blocking。/ Guardrails come in two forms: pre-execution blocking and post-execution accountability. I do the latter. Blocking = bottleneck = defeats purpose of agents. Accountability = know who did what, intervene fast when needed. I provide real guardrails without blocking.

1218.	你如何证明你不会造成安全风险？
How do you prove you won't cause security risk?
**答案/Answer**: SOC2 compliance（进行中）。数据加密at rest and in transit。Minimal access principle——只收需要的data。Security review documentation ready。不store sensitive payload content，只store metadata。/ SOC2 compliance (in progress). Data encrypted at rest and in transit. Minimal access principle—only collect needed data. Security review documentation ready. Don't store sensitive payload content, only store metadata.

1219.	你如何证明你能通过 security review？
How do you prove you can pass security review?
**答案/Answer**: Pre-built security questionnaire responses。Third-party pentest report（planned）。Architecture documentation showing data flow。Clear data retention and deletion policies。Work with customer security team proactively。/ Pre-built security questionnaire responses.

**答案/Answer**: [留空 - 关于我个人的问题] / [Left blank - personal question]

1222.	你如何在合同上承担责任？
How do you take responsibility in contracts?
**答案/Answer**: 标准SaaS liability terms：service credits for downtime，cap on liability。不会无限责任——那样任何startup都无法运营。但会commit to reasonable SLA and remediation。/ Standard SaaS liability terms: service credits for downtime, cap on liability. No unlimited liability—no startup can operate that way. But will commit to reasonable SLA and remediation.

1223.	你如何处理客户问："你出事谁赔？"
How do you handle customer asking: "Who compensates if you mess up?"
**答案/Answer**: Service credits for SLA violations。Liability capped at contract value。这是industry standard。如果你需要更高liability，需要enterprise tier with custom terms。但unlimited liability不合理。/ Service credits for SLA violations. Liability capped at contract value. This is industry standard. If you need higher liability, need enterprise tier with custom terms. But unlimited liability isn't reasonable.

1224.	你如何处理客户问："你倒闭我们怎么办？"
How do you handle customer asking: "What if you go out of business?"
**答案/Answer**: Data export available anytime。Open standards for event format。Transition period contractually guaranteed。Source code escrow for enterprise tier（如果需要）。你的data永远是你的。/ Data export available anytime. Open standards for event format. Transition period contractually guaranteed. Source code escrow for enterprise tier (if needed). Your data is always yours.

1225.	你如何处理客户问："你被收购我们怎么办？"
How do you handle customer asking: "What if you get acquired?"
**答案/Answer**: Acquisition不一定是坏事——可能带来更多resources。但：contract includes assignment clause（我们不能随意转让合同without consent）。如果acquirer changes terms，你可以exit with data。/ Acquisition isn't necessarily bad—might bring more resources. But: contract includes assignment clause (we can't transfer contract without consent). If acquirer changes terms, you can exit with data.

1226.	你如何处理客户问："你数据会不会被泄露？"
How do you handle customer asking: "Will my data be leaked?"
**答案/Answer**: 加密 at rest and in transit。Access controls——只有需要的人能访问。Audit logs of all data access。SOC2 compliance。Security breach notification within 24h。我们的business depends on data security。/ Encryption at rest and in transit. Access controls—only people who need can access. Audit logs of all data access. SOC2 compliance. Security breach notification within 24h. Our business depends on data security.

1227.	你如何处理客户问："你系统会不会被攻击？"

**答案/Answer**: 任何互联网系统都会被攻击。问题是defense depth。我们：WAF, DDoS protection, rate limiting, input validation, regular security audits。被攻击是certainty，penetration是我们努力prevent的。/ Any internet system will be attacked. Question is defense depth. We: WAF, DDoS protection, rate limiting, input validation, regular security audits. Being attacked is certainty, penetration is what we work to prevent.

1228.	你如何处理客户问："你员工会不会看我们数据？"
How do you handle customer asking: "Will your employees see our data?"
**答案/Answer**: Minimal access principle。大部分员工不能access customer data。Support需要时：需要explicit permission，access logged，time-limited。可提供audit report of who accessed what。/ Minimal access principle. Most employees can't access customer data. When support needs: requires explicit permission, access logged, time-limited. Can provide audit report of who accessed what.

1229.	你如何处理客户问："你会不会拿我们数据训练？"
How do you handle customer asking: "Will you use our data for training?"
**答案/Answer**: 明确contractual commitment：不会用customer data训练ML models。你的data只用于为你提供服务。DPA (Data Processing Agreement) 里写清楚。不会偷偷用data。/ Clear contractual commitment: won't use customer data to train ML models. Your data only used to serve you. Stated clearly in DPA (Data Processing Agreement). Won't secretly use data.

1230.	你如何处理客户问："你是不是在监控员工？"
How do you handle customer asking: "Are you monitoring employees?"
**答案/Answer**: 不是监控员工——是监控agent actions。Agent actions需要被track for safety。Human actions只在和agent有关时才visible（比如谁acknowledged incident）。不做general employee surveillance。/ Not monitoring employees—monitoring agent actions. Agent actions need to be tracked for safety. Human actions only visible when agent-related (like who acknowledged incident). Don't do general employee surveillance.

1231.	你如何处理客户问："你是不是在做 DLP？"
How do you handle customer asking: "Are you doing DLP?"
**答案/Answer**: 不是DLP。DLP防止数据泄露，监控data movement。我们track agent actions for operational coordination。不scan content for sensitive data。不阻止data transfer。完全不同的use case。/ Not DLP. DLP prevents data leakage, monitors data movement. We track agent actions for operational coordination. Don't scan content for sensitive data. Don't block data transfer. Completely different use case.

1232.	你如何处理客户问："你是不是 SIEM？"
How do you handle customer asking: "Are you a SIEM?"
**答案/Answer**: 不是SIEM。SIEM聚合security events for threat detection。我们聚合agent actions for operational coordination。Different events, different analysis, different output。但可以feed data to your SIEM。/ Not SIEM. SIEM aggregates security events for threat detection. We aggregate agent actions for operational coordination. Different events, different analysis, different output. But can feed data to your SIEM.

1233.	你如何处理客户问："你是不是 SOAR？"
How do you handle customer asking: "Are you a SOAR?"
**答案/Answer**: 不是SOAR。SOAR自动化security playbooks。我们不自动execute security responses——我们route to humans让他们decide。我们是coordination layer，不是automation layer。Human in the loop。/ Not SOAR. SOAR automates security playbooks. We don't auto-execute security responses—we route to humans to let them decide. We're coordination layer, not automation layer. Human in the loop.

1234.	你如何解释你与这些系统的边界？
How do you explain your boundaries with these systems?
**答案/Answer**: 我们处理agent actions，他们处理security events。我们route to humans，他们automate responses。我们focus on coordination，他们focus on detection/prevention。可以co-exist，data可以互feed。/ We handle agent actions, they handle security events. We route to humans, they automate responses. We focus on coordination, they focus on detection/prevention. Can co-exist, data can feed each other.

1235.	你如何解释你为什么值得新增一个供应商？
How do you explain why you're worth adding as a new vendor?
**答案/Answer**: 新vendor增加complexity。但：agent governance gap是real的，你现有vendor不cover。问题越critical，越值得dedicated tool。算一下：agent incident平均MTTR减少多少？那个时间值多少钱？/ New vendor adds complexity. But: agent governance gap is real, your existing vendors don't cover. More critical the problem, more worth a dedicated tool. Calculate: how much does average agent incident MTTR reduce? What's that time worth?

1236.	你如何解释你对客户现有体系的扰动最小？
How do you explain you cause minimal disruption to customer's existing system?
**答案/Answer**: Integration轻量：MCP hook for agents, webhook for events, optional UI。不需要改你的agent code、不需要改你的infra、不需要改你的workflows。Additive not invasive。/ Integration is lightweight: MCP hook for agents, webhook for events, optional UI. No need to change your agent code, no need to change your infra, no need to change your workflows. Additive not invasive.

1237.	你如何解释你上线不会引入更多噪音？
How do you explain you won't introduce more noise when going live?
**答案/Answer**: 我们的goal是reduce noise不是add noise。Routing rules filter what's important。Learning loop adjusts over time。Config让你control notification frequency。如果你getting too many notifications——that's config issue we help you tune。/ Our goal is reduce noise not add noise. Routing rules filter what's important. Learning loop adjusts over time. Config lets you control notification frequency. If you're getting too many notifications—that's config issue we help you tune.

1238.	你如何解释你能减少 MTTR？证据？
How do you explain you can reduce MTTR? Evidence?
**答案/Answer**: MTTR = time to detect + time to triage + time to fix。我们减少triage时间（谁该处理、影响范围是什么）。Early design partner data needed——但hypothesis是：找到对的人从hours变成minutes。/ MTTR = time to detect + time to triage + time to fix. We reduce triage time (who should handle, what's blast radius). Early design partner data needed—but hypothesis is: finding right person goes from hours to minutes.

1239.	你如何解释你能减少重复事故？证据？
How do you explain you can reduce repeated incidents? Evidence?
**答案/Answer**: Learning loop：incident → postmortem → pattern → rule。下次similar event自动被flagged。Early stage没有长期数据，但mechanism是clear的：记住patterns，apply to future events。这是closed-loop design。/ Learning loop: incident → postmortem → pattern → rule. Next time similar event auto-flagged. Early stage no long-term data, but mechanism is clear: remember patterns, apply to future events. This is closed-loop design.

1240.	你如何解释你能提高责任归属准确率？证据？
How do you explain you can improve attribution accuracy? Evidence?
**答案/Answer**: Attribution基于ownership graph + event chain。比"谁last touched"更准确。图谱由客户定义（他们知道谁owns什么）。我们只automate lookup，不guess ownership。Accuracy来自correct configuration。/ Attribution based on ownership graph + event chain. More accurate than "who last touched." Graph defined by customer (they know who owns what). We only automate lookup, don't guess ownership. Accuracy comes from correct configuration.

1241.	你如何解释你不是"管理工具"？
How do you explain you're not a "management tool"?
**答案/Answer**: 我们是operational coordination，不是performance management。不track individual productivity。不generate scorecards。Focus是：事故发生时找对的人，不是evaluate谁做得好。/ We're operational coordination, not performance management. Don't track individual productivity. Don't generate scorecards. Focus is: find right person when incident happens, not evaluate who performs well.

1242.	你如何解释你不会变成"Jira for incidents"？
How do you explain you won't become "Jira for incidents"?
**答案/Answer**: Jira是project management（tickets, workflows, approvals）。我们是real-time coordination（events, routing, intervention）。不做ticket lifecycle management。Focus是speed of response，不是tracking completion。/ Jira is project management (tickets, workflows, approvals). We're real-time coordination (events, routing, intervention). Don't do ticket lifecycle management. Focus is speed of response, not tracking completion.

1243.	你如何解释你不会让组织政治更糟？
How do you explain you won't make organizational politics worse?
**答案/Answer**: Politics来自blame。我们promote blameless culture：focus on what happened not who did wrong。Postmortem template强调system improvement not individual fault。Transparency减少politics不是增加。/ Politics comes from blame. We promote blameless culture: focus on what happened not who did wrong. Postmortem template emphasizes system improvement not individual fault. Transparency reduces politics not increases.

1244.	你如何解释你不会变成"问责机器"？
How do you explain you won't become an "accountability machine"?
**答案/Answer**: Accountability和blame不同。Accountability = 知道谁responsible for what（enable coordination）。Blame = punish mistakes（create fear）。我们enable前者，explicitly discourage后者。Documentation和messaging都reinforce blameless approach。/ Accountability and blame are different. Accountability = knowing who responsible for what (enable coordination). Blame = punish mistakes (create fear). We enable former, explicitly discourage latter. Documentation and messaging reinforce blameless approach.

1245.	你如何解释你不会被 HR 拿去考核？
How do you explain you won't be used by HR for performance reviews?
**答案/Answer**: 不提供individual performance metrics。Data access控制在engineering/ops team。不export "who made most mistakes"报告。如果客户misuse tool for HR purposes——那是他们的cultural problem，不是我们的product design。/ Don't provide individual performance metrics. Data access controlled to engineering/ops team. Don't export "who made most mistakes" reports. If customers misuse tool for HR purposes—that's their cultural problem, not our product design.

1246.	你如何解释你不会让工程师抵触？
How do you explain you won't make engineers resistant?
**答案/Answer**: Engineers抵触的是：more alerts, more processes, more paperwork。我们减少这些：smarter routing (fewer irrelevant alerts), faster triage (less manual investigation), learning loop (fewer repeated issues)。Tool应该让life easier not harder。/ Engineers resist: more alerts, more processes, more paperwork. We reduce these: smarter routing (fewer irrelevant alerts), faster triage (less manual investigation), learning loop (fewer repeated issues). Tool should make life easier not harder.

1247.	你如何解释你能在大组织推广？
How do you explain you can scale in large organizations?
**答案/Answer**: 大组织需要：SSO/SAML, role-based access, multi-team support, audit logs。我们have或planned these。而且大组织的problem更大（more agents, more chaos），我们的value也更大。Pain scales with size。/ Large orgs need: SSO/SAML, role-based access, multi-team support, audit logs. We have or have planned these. And large orgs' problems are bigger (more agents, more chaos), our value is also bigger. Pain scales with size.

1248.	你如何解释你能在小组织卖？
How do you explain you can sell to small organizations?
**答案/Answer**: 小组织：10-50人，10+ agents。他们的problem是：没有dedicated ops team but still need coordination。我们的self-serve tier低门槛。Value prop不变：faster intervention。不需要enterprise features。/ Small orgs: 10-50 people, 10+ agents. Their problem is: no dedicated ops team but still need coordination. Our self-serve tier is low barrier. Value prop unchanged: faster intervention. No need for enterprise features.

1249.	你如何解释你的 TAM 足够大？
How do you explain your TAM is large enough?
**答案/Answer**: TAM = companies deploying autonomous agents × price per agent。Agent adoption在accelerate。今年10% companies have agents，明年30%。每家10-100 agents，$50-100/agent/month。Math works out to billions even with conservative estimates。/ TAM = companies deploying autonomous agents × price per agent. Agent adoption accelerating. This year 10% companies have agents, next year 30%. Each with 10-100 agents, $50-100/agent/month. Math works out to billions even with conservative estimates.

1250.	你如何解释你不是 hype？
How do you explain you're not hype?
**答案/Answer**: Rubrik拿到funding做这个，Datadog在DASH发布AI Agents Console。大公司验证问题是real的。我们的differentiation是approach，不是problem existence。问题不是hype——是解法之争。/ Rubrik got funding to do this, Datadog announced AI Agents Console at DASH. Big companies validate problem is real. Our differentiation is approach, not problem existence. Problem isn't hype—it's competition of solutions.
R2. 站在 Rubrik 角度（50）
R2. From Rubrik's perspective (50)
1251.	你说我只做 snapshot rewind，但 rewind 很值钱，你如何不被碾压？
You say I only do snapshot rewind, but rewind is very valuable. How do you avoid being crushed?
**答案/Answer**: Rewind是valuable for data recovery。但rewind之前需要决定：该不该rewind？rewind到哪个point？谁有权限decide？这是coordination问题，你不解决。我解决前置问题，然后可以call你的rewind。/ Rewind is valuable for data recovery. But before rewind you need to decide: should we rewind? To which point? Who has authority to decide? This is coordination problem, you don't solve. I solve the prerequisite problem, then can call your rewind.

1252.	你说 rollback 是社会能力，那我们做的就是技术 rollback，你凭什么说错？
You say rollback is social capability—we do technical rollback. Why do you say we're wrong?
**答案/Answer**: 你的技术rollback没错——对于data layer它是对的。但：很多agent actions不只影响data（emails sent, APIs called, configs changed）。技术rollback covers subset of problems。Social coordination covers all problems。/ Your technical rollback isn't wrong—for data layer it's right. But: many agent actions don't just affect data (emails sent, APIs called, configs changed). Technical rollback covers subset of problems. Social coordination covers all problems.

1253.	你如何证明客户更需要"who to call"而不是"数据恢复"？
How do you prove customers need "who to call" more than "data recovery"?
**答案/Answer**: 不是more——是both。但data recovery只有在有人decide to recover时才有用。"Who to call"是prerequisite。没有coordination，你的rewind button没人知道该不该按。Sequential dependency。/ Not more—it's both. But data recovery only useful when someone decides to recover. "Who to call" is prerequisite. Without coordination, no one knows whether to press your rewind button. Sequential dependency.

1254.	你如何证明两者不是互补？你为什么不合作？
How do you prove the two aren't complementary? Why don't you cooperate?
**答案/Answer**: 两者IS互补。我们应该合作。你的rewind可以是我们recovery options之一。Customer用我们找对的人做决定，然后trigger你的rewind。这是理想的integration。/ The two ARE complementary. We should cooperate. Your rewind can be one of our recovery options. Customer uses us to find right person to decide, then triggers your rewind. This is ideal integration.

1255.	你如何解释你不做数据层 rollback 的原因？
How do you explain why you don't do data layer rollback?
**答案/Answer**: Data layer rollback需要deep integration with storage infrastructure。你已经做了而且做得好。我们不需要re-invent。我们做coordination layer——知道什么时候该rollback，谁该做决定。不同layer，complementary。/ Data layer rollback requires deep integration with storage infrastructure. You already do it and do it well. We don't need to re-invent. We do coordination layer—knowing when to rollback, who should decide. Different layers, complementary.

1256.	你如何处理客户问："你没有数据恢复，那你怎么救火？"
How do you handle customer asking: "You don't have data recovery—how do you fight fires?"
**答案/Answer**: 我们不directly恢复data——我们让正确的人更快知道该恢复什么。我们integrate with recovery tools（包括Rubrik）。Recovery execution不是我们的job——coordination是。消防队需要消防车（你）也需要调度中心（我）。/ We don't directly recover data—we help the right people know faster what to recover. We integrate with recovery tools (including Rubrik). Recovery execution isn't our job—coordination is. Fire department needs fire trucks (you) and dispatch center (me).

1257.	你如何解释你是协调层仍然能带来更快恢复？
How do you explain being coordination layer can still bring faster recovery?
**答案/Answer**: Recovery time = detection + triage + execution。你optimize execution。我们optimize detection和triage。Combined total recovery time更短。你让recovery fast，我们让"knowing what to recover"fast。/ Recovery time = detection + triage + execution. You optimize execution. We optimize detection and triage. Combined total recovery time is shorter. You make recovery fast, we make "knowing what to recover" fast.

1258.	你如何证明协调层能让恢复速度比 rewind 更快？
How do you prove coordination layer can make recovery faster than rewind alone?
**答案/Answer**: 不是faster than rewind——是faster time to rewind decision。Rewind执行速度你控制，我不能让它更快。但：从incident发生到有人点rewind——这个时间我可以缩短。/ Not faster than rewind—faster time to rewind decision. Rewind execution speed you control, I can't make it faster. But: from incident happening to someone clicking rewind—this time I can shorten.

1259.	你如何在事故里不掌握数据仍然有价值？
How do you have value in incidents without controlling the data?
**答案/Answer**: Data是material，coordination是process。你有material但不知道谁应该用。我有process能找到对的人，但需要call你的APIs来execute。Value来自orchestration，不是data ownership。/ Data is material, coordination is process. You have material but don't know who should use it. I have process to find right person, but need to call your APIs to execute. Value comes from orchestration, not data ownership.

1260.	你如何拿到事件与变更的证据链？
How do you get the evidence chain of events and changes?
**答案/Answer**: MCP interceptor captures agent actions。Integration with source control, deployment tools, config management。你的snapshots可以作为data source。Evidence chain = agent action + timestamp + affected resources + owner lookup。/ MCP interceptor captures agent actions. Integration with source control, deployment tools, config management. Your snapshots can be data source. Evidence chain = agent action + timestamp + affected resources + owner lookup.

1261.	你如何处理客户把你当 backup 的替代？
How do you handle customers treating you as backup replacement?
**答案/Answer**: 明确messaging：我们不是backup替代。你仍然需要backup solution。我们complement backup不是replace。Sales过程clarify scope。如果客户expectation mismatch——better to lose deal than disappoint later。/ Clear messaging: we're not backup replacement. You still need backup solution. We complement backup not replace. Sales process clarifies scope. If customer expectation mismatch—better to lose deal than disappoint later.

1262.	你如何明确边界避免误售？
How do you clarify boundaries to avoid misselling?
**答案/Answer**: Sales材料explicitly说：我们做coordination，不做data backup/recovery execution。Feature comparison表显示scope。Demo不show data recovery。如果客户问"你能恢复我的DB吗"——答案是明确的no。/ Sales materials explicitly say: we do coordination, not data backup/recovery execution. Feature comparison shows scope. Demo doesn't show data recovery. If customer asks "can you restore my DB"—answer is clear no.

1263.	你如何防止客户失望？
How do you prevent customer disappointment?
**答案/Answer**: Expectation management at every touchpoint。Pilot期间validate they're using us for right use case。Success metrics定义清楚（TTI reduction，not recovery success rate）。如果客户指标mismatch——flag early。/ Expectation management at every touchpoint. During pilot validate they're using us for right use case. Success metrics defined clearly (TTI reduction, not recovery success rate). If customer metrics mismatch—flag early.

1264.	你如何处理 rubrik 未来加 routing？
How do you handle Rubrik adding routing in the future?
**答案/Answer**: 你加routing是feature，我整个product是routing。你的routing会被deprioritized behind backup improvements。我的routing gets 100% focus。Customer会选择：bundled good-enough还是standalone best-in-class。/ Your adding routing is a feature, my whole product is routing. Your routing will be deprioritized behind backup improvements. My routing gets 100% focus. Customer will choose: bundled good-enough or standalone best-in-class.

1265.	你如何处理 rubrik 把 routing 绑定到 backup 套餐？
How do you handle Rubrik bundling routing into backup package?
**答案/Answer**: Bundling让你的routing是free但not optimized。Customers用你的routing发现不够好→来找我。我的job是做best routing possible。If your bundled routing是enough for them——那不是我的target customer。/ Bundling makes your routing free but not optimized. Customers use your routing, find it insufficient → come to me. My job is do best routing possible. If your bundled routing is enough for them—that's not my target customer.

1266.	你如何处理 rubrik 的渠道优势？
How do you handle Rubrik's channel advantage?
**答案/Answer**: 你的channel sells backup to enterprises。我的channel can be different：developer communities, agent framework ecosystems。不需要compete in your channel——build my own。Different buyer personas。/ Your channel sells backup to enterprises. My channel can be different: developer communities, agent framework ecosystems. Don't need to compete in your channel—build my own. Different buyer personas.
